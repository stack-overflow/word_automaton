I HAVE the pleasure to present to the Hakluyt Society, in the
accompanying volume, the first two historians who wrote on the conquest
of the Rio de la Plata, which took place in the reign of Charles V, King
of Spain and Emperor of Germany.

The first of these was a German, a native of Straubing, in Bavaria,
whose name was Ulrich Schmidt. The second was a Spaniard, native of
Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, named Alvar Nunez, better known by
the surname which he took from his mother, Dona Teresa Cabeza de Vaca.
This Alvar Nunez was a grandson of Don Pedro Vera, who, in the time of
Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholics, undertook to conquer the Canary
Islands at his own cost. As his means, however, were insufficient for so
great an enterprise, he borrowed money of a Moorish banker upon pledge.
The security given by this inhuman father consisted of his two sons, the
younger of whom was the father of Alvar Nunez; and this transaction,
characteristic of a soldier in those semi-barbarous times, seemed to
presage the singular adventures in which the son of the latter was
destined to take part.

Of the German's lineage nothing is known. I believe him to have been an
obscure individual, servant or agent, like the modern _commis voyageurs_
or commercial travellers, for one of the wealthy houses of commerce
established at Seville in the time of the Emperor, and concerning which
I shall have something to say by-and-by.

Both the German adventurer as well as the Andalusian cavalier gave their
names to the narratives of what happened to them in America, in the two
books published together in the present volume.

       *       *       *       *       *

Twelve years after the discovery of the river Plate in 1516, by Juan
Diaz de Solis, two Spanish expeditions explored its shores. One of these
had been sent out by the Emperor to India, under the orders of Sebastian
Cabot, and the other, under the command of the pilot Diego Garcia, to
take possession of that river. Cabot altered his course and went up the
Paraná till he arrived at the Rio Paraguai in 1527, and Garcia made the
same voyage the following year. Both these navigators shortly afterwards
returned to Spain, having only left a small colony at Sancti Spiritus,
in the neighbourhood of the present city of Rosario, which was soon
transferred to Iguape, on the Atlantic coast, very near the limit fixed,
by the treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, between the possessions of Spain
and Portugal.

When Cabot returned to Spain in 1530, and told of the pieces of silver
he had seen among the Indians of the Chaco, the King of Portugal sent
Martin Affonso de Souza to establish himself in the extreme south of his
possessions in Brazil; and this Portuguese captain, after examining
the coast of the ocean as far as the entrance of the Rio de la Plata,
founded at the close of the year 1531, in the island of San Vicente, the
first regular colony on that coast where now stands the little city of
Santos.

The vicinity of these two rival colonies--the much smaller Spanish one
of Iguape, and the stronger Portuguese one in San Vicente--endangered
the peaceful and tranquil possession of those lands; and for this
reason the Spanish Government resolved on sending immediately a formal
expedition which should permanently occupy the north of the territory
belonging to it, according to the above-mentioned treaty, on that coast.
This expedition was placed under the orders of the first Adelantado
and Captain-General of the province of Rio de la Plata, Don Pedro de
Mendoza.

With him sailed a ship belonging to some Flemish merchants established
in Seville, and in this vessel went their servant, or agent, one Ulrich
Schmidt, a native of Bavaria, whom the Spaniards called Schmidel, a
name which was Latinized, according to the custom of that time, into
Uldericus Faber.

This Bavarian remained in the province of the Rio de la Plata some
twenty years, taking an active, though obscure, part in the events of
the Spanish conquest of that part of America. In December 1552, he
returned to his native country, visiting Seville in September of the
following year, and Antwerp in January 1554. Thirteen years afterwards
there appeared in Germany, in a collection of voyages published at
Frankfort-on-Maine by Sebastian Franck, a narrative of Schmidt's voyage
under the following title:

"Warhafftige und liebliche Beschreibung etlicher fürnemen Indianischen
Landschafften und Insulen, die vormals in keiner Chronicken gedacht, und
erstlich in der schiffart Ulrici Schmidts von Straubingen, mit grosser
gefahr erkündigt, und von ihm selber auffs fleissigst beschrieben und
dargethan."

This is the book translated into English, for the first time, from
the original German, and now published by the Hakluyt Society. It is
unnecessary for me to say that the translation is not my work.

The historical period embraced by the voyage of Schmidt extends from
1535 to 1552, and refers to the governorship of Don Pedro de Mendoza,
of his successor, Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, and to the principal part
taken in the events of that period by Captain Domingo Martinez de Irala,
under whose orders the author of the narrative continually served.
Irala, actuated by personal ambition, defeated the plans of Mendoza,
deserted Buenos Ayres, abandoned his second in command in the Chaco,
occasioning his death and that of all those who had accompanied him
across that great desert to the confines of Peru, and, when the
second Adelantado, Alvar Nunez, arrived, opposed him by intrigues and
conspiracy till he contrived to depose and send him in chains to Spain,
under the insidious and calumnious accusation of having committed all
sorts of crimes.

Alvar Nunez, after waiting judgment for eight years, was acquitted, and
recompensed by the king, and to justify himself before the world he
published a narrative of the events that had happened to him during his
term of office, viz., from 1541 to 1544.

This record, the first published on the conquest of the Rio de la Plata
and Paraguai, appeared in Valladolid in 1555, under the general title
"_Relacion y Comentarios de Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, de lo acaecido
en las dos jornadas que hizo a las Indias_." The _Relacion_ refers to
his adventures in Florida, and was first published in 1542,[1] while
the _Comentarios_ appeared as a second part of the new edition of
his voyages under the title just mentioned. This is the second book
contained in the present volume.

  [1] This part has been translated into English by Buckingham Smith,
  and published in Washington in 1851.

The _Voyage_ of Ulrich Schmidt, and the _Commentaries_ of Alvar Nunez,
are, as it were, the flint and steel which, when struck together,
produce light.

The work of Schmidt, which in nearly all its details is in manifest
contradiction to that of Alvar Nunez, was published twelve years after
the _Commentaries_, and was apparently written expressly to refute them,
taking up the defence of Domingo de Irala, who is the principal figure
of the picture, and whose seditious and immoral conduct had been
denounced by Alvar Nunez. The Hakluyt Society, in bringing together
these two contemporary records of the Spanish conquest, leaves the
reader to pass his own judgment on the issues raised.

This Society had published in 1874 another narrative, similar to that of
Ulrich Schmidt, relating to the same historical period, the voyage of
Hans Stade, also a German adventurer, who visited the southern coast of
Brazil shortly after the sedition against Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca
in Paraguai. Though edited with notes and explanations by the gallant
Captain, afterwards Sir Richard Burton,[2] these have not thrown
the necessary light to show the motive of Stade's voyage, nor other
circumstances essential to form a clear and precise idea how this other
German adventurer is entitled to a place in the history of the Province
of the Rio de la Plata as well as in that of the conquest of Brazil.

  [2] Sir Richard Burton died in Trieste on the 20th October last, while
  holding the office of H.B.M. Consul.

When Alvar Nunez returned a prisoner to Spain, the king appointed
another Adelantado to replace him and continue the Spanish colonisation
from which he had been so violently severed. This new governor of the
Rio de la Plata was Don Juan de Sanabria, who died before starting on
the voyage, and only after many difficulties his son, Don Diego, sailed
from San Lucar de Barrameda in 1549 with three ships. In one of these
Hans Stade embarked, on conditions identical with those under which
Ulrich Schmidt had gone to America with Don Pedro de Mendoza. The armada
of Sanabria was dispersed on the voyage; its chief arrived at the
Antilles, and only two of the ships reached their destination.

Sanabria, just like Alvar Nunez, bore the king's orders to establish
himself in the ports of the Atlantic coast, in proximity with the
Portuguese colony of San Vicente, to take possession of the island of
Santa Catalina, to found in its neighbourhood a colony on the border
of the sea, in order to penetrate thence by land, crossing the whole
province of Guaira, or Paraná, till he arrived at Paraguai.

The enterprise of Sanabria was, however, very unfortunate. The
colonists, when their resources failed them, divided. A considerable
number took refuge in the colony of San Vicente, impelled by necessity,
and seduced by the Portuguese governor, Thomé de Souza. Hans Stade went
with these, and as he understood something of gunnery, abandoned the
Spaniards, and entered the Portuguese service as an artilleryman, when
his chiefs and companions returned to Spanish territory and founded the
colony of San Francisco, in 26° 20' of south latitude.

The first seventeen chapters of Stade's book refer to his stay in
the province of Sanabria; the remainder to the time he passed in San
Vicente, and his captivity among the Tupis who inhabited the surrounding
country.

These three books are, as it were, fragments of the history of the first
few years of the conquest of one part of South America. The series,
arranged chronologically, is as follows:--

  1. _The Voyage of Ulrich Schmidt_, from 1534 to 1554;

  2. _The Commentaries of Alvar Nunez_, from 1541 to 1544;

  3. _The Captivity of Hans Stade_, from 1547 to 1554.

The special merit of these three works is that their authors were
eye-witnesses and actors in the events they narrate.

       *       *       *       *       *

It has seemed to me interesting and necessary to add to this volume an
ethnographical map, which shows what were the indigenous tribes which
occupied the country described by Schmidt, and the places in which the
Guaraní family lived in that part of the province of Rio de la Plata,
colonised in those days by the Spaniards. This map also shows, for
the first time in the history of cartography, the demarcation of this
same province entrusted by the King of Spain to his Adelantados, or
governors, and the route opened by Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca on his
journey from the island of Santa Catalina to Asuncion, on the Paraguai.

       *       *       *       *       *

The name of Rio de la Plata, given by the King of Spain to a territory
so vast, and differing so widely now from what it was at the time of
the conquest, creates some confusion and uncertainty in the mind of
the reader of the events of that period. This can only be removed by
a map which shows clearly what territories were held by the Spanish
and Portuguese by virtue of the treaty of Tordesillas. Those who are
cognisant of it are but few in number. When speaking or writing of the
conquest of America, it is generally believed that the only title upon
which were based the conquests of Spain and Portugal was the famous
Papal Bull of partition of the Ocean, of 1493. Few modern authors take
into consideration that this Bull was amended, upon the petition of the
King of Portugal, by the above-mentioned treaty, signed by both Powers
in 1494, augmenting the portion assigned to the Portuguese in the
partition made between them of the continent of America. The arc of
meridian fixed by this treaty as a dividing line, which gave rise,
owing to the ignorance of that age, to so many diplomatic congresses
and interminable controversies, may now be traced by any student of
elementary mathematics. This line is shown on the accompanying map, and
runs along the meridian of 47° 32' 56” west of Greenwich. The coast of
the South American continent between the equator and the vicinity of the
Tropic of Capricorn describes a great curve, closed on the west by the
aforesaid dividing line, which enters the sea a little south of San
Vicente, or Santos. West of this line were the Spanish possessions. A
clear understanding on this point removes the confusion occurring at the
present day, when the situation of affairs has undergone so marked a
change, and explains how it is that Don Pedro de Mendoza, Alvar Nunez,
and Hans Stade remained at points of the coast called of Brazil,
mentioned by those travellers; and how Alvar Nunez, without leaving the
province under his jurisdiction and command, marched through Spanish
territory, from Santa Catalina, across the whole of Guaira, or province
of Paraná, to Asuncion on the Paraguai. The name "Brazil", or "tierra
del Brasil", at that time referred only to the part of the continent
producing the dyewood so-called. Nearly two centuries later the
Portuguese advanced towards the south, and the name "Brazil" then
covered the new possessions they were acquiring, thus introducing the
confusion to which I have referred.

_The Voyage of Schmidt_ went through several editions, all incorrect,
and rendered more so by the so-called elucidations and notes by their
early editors. It was translated and published in Latin, English,
Spanish, and other languages. These translations, however, were not
made directly from the German, in which it was written, and thus the
inaccuracies contained in the original were increased as they were
turned into other idioms by persons who had no knowledge of the history,
nor the slightest notion of the language spoken by the natives of
America.

The first translation was done into Latin by Professor Gotard Arthus,
for Theodore de Bry's _Collection of Voyages_, 1597; and when Levinus
Hulsius prepared his collection, in 1599, he found so many defects in
it, that, instead of adopting it, he preferred translating it afresh.
This version, in which there are many alterations and suppressions of
the original text, must in justice be described as not less defective
than the preceding one, without, however, being quite so bad. The Latin
version of Hulsius served for the subsequent translations into modern
languages--for instance, for that inserted by Purchas in his _Pilgrims_.

From the same collection of Hulsius the work of Schmidt was translated
from Latin into Spanish by Dr. Andreas Gonzalez de Barcia, and published
with his insignificant and incorrect notes in Madrid, 1737, in his
_Coleccion de Historiadores Primitivos de las Indias Occidentales_. This
is the version reproduced at Buenos Ayres a century later by Don Pedro
de Angelis, compiler and editor of the manuscripts of the Argentine
canon, Don Saturnino Segurola.

The translation now published by the Hakluyt Society, done directly from
the original German, has the merit of presenting the work genuine and
entire as it left the author's hands. And as he was led into many errors
of fact, proper names, geography, and chronology, the Society has
done me the honour to ask me to explain them by notes and this brief
Introduction.

       *       *       *       *       *

The expedition of Don Pedro de Mendoza to the Rio de la Plata, and all
the events referred to by Ulrich Schmidt, belong to the epoch of Charles
V, Emperor of Germany and King of Spain. Although he was the son of a
Spanish prince, this monarch was born at Ghent, and had been educated
by Flemings. His ministers, his counsellors, the bankers who supplied
him with the funds for his wars, were Flemings. Great was the favour
enjoyed in Spain and Portugal by those very wealthy bankers and
merchants, Fugger and Welzer of Augsburg, and Erasmus Schetzen of
Antwerp. The first two had opened branches of their business at Seville,
the centre at that time of trade with America, and the third had done
the same at Lisbon, the metropolis of the Portuguese colonies in the
Indies. The house of Erasmus Schetzen, as Hans Stade tells us, had sugar
factories in the recently colonised captaincy of San Vicente, since
converted into the province of San Pablo. One of his agents, Peter
Rosel, had established himself there, and had acquired, in the name of
Erasmus, the great factory established by the grantee, Captain-Major
Martin Affonso de Souza, together with other partners.[3] Charles V had
made a gift of the whole province of Caracas to the bankers Welzer, and
the affairs of the Fuggers were so vast that the family name was adopted
into the Castilian vernacular as _fucar_, explained by the dictionary of
the language to signify a person of great wealth.

  [3] Fray Gaspar da Madre de Deos, _Memorias para a historia da
  Capitania de S. Vicente_, 1797.

Charles V had inaugurated his reign by showing his partiality for the
Flemings, by whom he was surrounded, bestowing on the Baron de la
Bresa, his counsellor and majordomo mayor, the first contract for the
exclusive privilege of introducing negro slaves into the West Indies,
against the advice of his Spanish counsellors, who rejected the project
of the famous protector of the Indians, Bartholomé de las Casas.[4]
These favours shown to the Flemings gave rise to that picturesque phrase
of Pedro Martyr de Anghiera, that the Flemings had gone with Charles V
to Spain to destroy the vine after having gathered the vintage.[5]

  [4] Antonio de Herrera, _Historia General de los Hechos de los
  Castellanos, etc._, Década 2, Libro 2, cap. 20; Quintana, _Vida de
  las Casas_.

  [5] P. Martyr, _Opus Epistolarum_, carta 703.

This explains how the Spanish Government, exclusive and jealous of all
foreign interference in its affairs in the Indies, allowed Germans and
Flemings, with their vessels, their merchandise, and their men, to take
part in such considerable numbers in the expedition of Don Pedro de
Mendoza. The Flemings were at that time as much Charles's subjects as
the Spaniards, and the owners of the ships in which Schmidt and his
countrymen sailed, were bankers--allies and favourites of the young
Emperor.

It appears that Schmidt was not enlisted among the soldiers of Mendoza,
but came as an _employé_ of the house of Welzer and Niedhart, who owned
the vessel which took him. Its factor was the Fleming Heinrich Paine,
and it was manned by eighty Germans. The cargo was destined to exchange
for the silver which Sebastian Cabot, after his recent voyage of
discovery, had made it believed in Spain, abounded among the Indians he
had encountered on the Paraguai. The Rio de Solis then took the name of
Rio de la Plata, and it was this magic word that raised the desires of
so many in Spain to take part in the expedition of Don Pedro de Mendoza,
that it was necessary to close the lists of applicants and hasten the
departure of the armada, in order to calm the fever of emigration which
prevailed on this occasion among persons desirous of making their
fortunes rapidly. This expedition, as the historian Fernandez de Oviedo,
who saw it sail from Seville, expressed it, "was a company fit to make a
goodly show in Casar's army and in any part of the world."

Don Pedro de Mendoza began by establishing himself in the port of Los
Patos, at the southern extremity of the island of Santa Catalina, which
was included in his jurisdiction, as may be seen on the accompanying
map. He then passed to the Rio de la Plata, and, on the 11th June 1535,
laid the foundations of the city of Santa Maria de Buenos Aires. Soon
afterwards he nominated as his second in command his intimate friend,
Juan de Ayolas, and sent him with a detachment to explore the Rio
Paraná, and open a road by means of this river to the Pacific Ocean,
which was the advance or front limit of his province.

The brigantines, or little feluccas in which the explorer Ayolas set
forth, were under the orders of the Biscayan, Domingo Martinez de Irala,
and in his company went Schmidt, but it is unknown in what character.
In his book he acquaints us with the events that happened to that
expedition, and all those in which he took part, almost always in the
company of his captain, Irala, with whose fortunes he linked his own
from the beginning. Our only authority for this statement is the
adventurer himself who has given his name to the book. I know of no
document mentioning Schmidt, nor is he noticed by the chronicler
Francisco Lopez de Gomara, by his successor, Antonio de Herrera, in his
history of the Indies, or by Ruy Diaz de Guzman, himself born on the
Paraguai, a grandson of Domingo Martinez de Irala, or, finally, by Alvar
Nunez in his _Commentaries_.

Schmidt relates that he was present at the foundation of Buenos Aires
and its desertion six years afterwards, by order of Irala, who possessed
himself of the command after the deaths of Don Pedro de Mendoza and his
lieutenant Ayolas. Schmidt was also present at the events which took
place during the governorship of the second Adelantado, Alvar Nunez
Cabeza de Vaca, from 1541 to 1544. He assisted at his violent overthrow
and deportation under the direction of Irala, made all the journeys of
exploration which, starting from Asuncion, ascended the Rio Paraguai to
Matto Grosso, and explored all the country of the Cheriguanos, now known
by the name of Moxos and Chiquitos, to the confines of Peru. He remained
with Irala till the arrival on the Atlantic coast of the expedition of
the Adelantado Sanabria, with whom Hans Stade sailed to America.

At the end of twenty years of travels and strange adventures, of combats
with Indians, of anarchy, poverty, and disorder among the conquerors of
Paraguai, when Domingo de Irala, by force of audacity and machiavelism,
had definitely possessed himself of the government of this unfortunate
colony, obtaining, a short while afterwards, the royal title of
Governor, his faithful and inseparable companion Schmidt received a
letter from the banker Niedhart, transmitted to him from Seville by the
agent there of the wealthy Fugger, in which he begged him to return to
Antwerp. Schmidt obtained leave of absence from his chief, set out on
his journey, with six deserters and twenty of his Indian slaves, by the
rivers Paraguai and Paraná to the river Iguazú, and thence crossed the
province of Guaira by the route opened by Alvar Nunez, arriving at the
Portuguese colony of San Vicente. Here he met with the agent of Erasmus
Schetzen, who gave him a passage to Lisbon in a vessel belonging to
his principal, which was laden with a cargo of sugar and brazil wood.
Schmidt landed at Antwerp on the 25th January 1554, as I have already
said.

Hans Stade was a prisoner of the Tapiis, or Tupis, in the immediate
vicinity of San Vicente, when Schmidt passed that way on his homeward
journey, and only succeeded in obtaining his liberty one year later,
embarking at Rio de Janeiro on one of the French ships which trafficked
with the Indians occupying that magnificent bay. His adventures during
his captivity were published at Marburg in 1557. It is very strange,
therefore, that Schmidt should not make the slightest mention of his
countryman, though he also was acquainted with Peter Rosel, agent of
Erasmus Schetzen, in the Portuguese colony. It would seem most natural
that they should have spoken on the misfortunes that had befallen Stade,
and on the various fruitless efforts made to rescue him from captivity,
and as to the means to be employed in order to restore him to his
country. Not a word of all this do we find in Schmidt's narrative.

       *       *       *       *       *

The voyage of Ulrich Schmidt to the Rio de la Plata was published, as we
have seen, at Frankfort-on-Maine in 1567, in the collection of Sebastian
Franck, wherein also appeared for the second time that of Stade, side by
side with his countryman Schmidt's. This proves the interest taken in
these narratives of travel in those days of theological controversies
and religious wars, when the French Protestants were trying to set foot
in Brazil, while Villegaignon, under the protection of Coligny, was
taking possession of the port of Rio de Janeiro, one year after the
abdication of Charles V and the accession to the throne of the sombre
Philip II, whose tyranny became very soon insupportable in the Low
Countries, which fell under his dominion by inheritance from his
father.

The publication of these travels answered to the propaganda against
Spain and the religious principles her soldiers were taking to the
New World. The work of Stade had been written by Dr. Johann Dryandri,
Professor of the University of Marburg, the centre of the ideas of
Luther. That of Schmidt was adopted and published by his countryman,
Sebastian Franck, who was a vehement Anabaptist, and by the Flemings de
Bry and his friend Hulsius, one of the most active advocates of Church
Reform, expelled from Ghent, his native place, by decree of the King of
Spain during the most critical period of the struggle maintained by the
Flemings for their national independence and their religious beliefs.[6]

  [6] J. Asher, _Bibliographical Essay on the Collection of Voyages and
  Travels edited and printed by Levinus Hulsius_.

In those times there existed no periodical press or newspaper. The
Spanish Government did not expose to the criticism of the world its
colonial policy; silence was its inviolable rule. Availing himself of
the right of his own defence, the Adelantado, Alvar Nunez Cabeza de
Vaca, deposed and accused by Irala and his party, had published, as
we have seen, the narrative of his Government of the Rio de la Plata.
Immediately afterwards there appeared in Germany the book of Ulrich
Schmidt, containing the charges against Alvar Nunez and the defence
of the conduct of his enemy. These conquerors of Paraguai accused one
another of disgraceful immorality and incapacity for the enterprize
entrusted to them by the King. Ambition, as we gather from these
books, overcame in them all feelings of honour and duty; and violence,
sedition, perfidy, and bloodshed, were the means by which they sought
to attain their ends.

The publication of these recriminations in Protestant Europe, which
looked on with fear at the growth of the power of Spain by her conquests
in the Indies, was a natural incentive to those who groaned under
her yoke. Having no periodical press, they availed themselves of the
narratives of voyages, which were awakening curiosity with respect to
countries that had fallen under her dominion. Everything for them was
new and wonderful. The unknown races, their primitive customs, their
savage life, their nakedness, their arms and food, the virgin nature and
splendid vegetation of the tropics, the fruits and new animals, the
game and fish, differing from those in the old world, all excited the
imagination, and, at the same time, opened a vast field for censure, and
for inciting the multitude against the enemy who was taking possession
with such admirable ease of the new lands which raised the enthusiasm of
the first discoverer to such a pitch that he believed they had contained
the earthly Paradise.

How could they help devouring with avidity "the veritable historie
and description of a country belonging to the wild, naked, savage,
man-eating people", narrated by Hans Stade, who had been their captive?
How could they fail to be interested in "the true and agreeable
description of some Indian lands and islands which have not been
recorded in former chronicles", by one who, like Schmidt, had first
explored them "amid great danger"?

It seems to me impossible that in the class of people to which Schmidt
and Stade belonged, there should have been found men capable of writing
narratives, though of scant literary merit. The art of writing was very
uncommon in the middle of the sixteenth century. We know by whom Stade's
work was prepared; but we have not the same information with regard to
that of Schmidt, though there can be no doubt that both were written,
not by those who appear as their authors, but by more learned persons,
enemies to the Spanish Government,[7] upon data recorded, badly or well,
by the adventurers themselves, and from what they heard from their
travelling companions.

The memory cannot retain for a long time names, and especially foreign
names, and details of events happening in the midst of grave anxieties
and dangers. For this reason Schmidt and Stade, who could not have taken
notes at the time, ran into such great errors, that it is impossible
to correct them with accuracy. The Castilian language is difficult to
pronounce for men of Northern Europe, and much more is this the case
with the Guaraní, which abounds with vowels and inarticulate sounds,
with an accent at times guttural, at others nasal, or both combined. The
Spanish Jesuit missionaries found themselves obliged to invent signs to
represent these sounds. Nevertheless, there are words which, although
pronounced in accordance with these signs, are now unintelligible to the
natives.

It seems to me beyond all doubt that Guaraní was the general language of
the whole of America to the east of the Cordillera of the Andes, from
the sea of the Antilles to the extreme south of the continent. There
were various dialects, as might be expected in a language without a
literature, spoken by tribes living apart and hostile to one another.
Traces of it occur north of the Amazon, as well as in the pampas of
Argentina, and especially in Paraguai and in Guaira, the chief centre
of the race in the days of the Spanish conquest. In Paraguai and its
immediate vicinity the tongue spoken is nearly as pure as in the time
of the Spanish missionaries Anchieta and Ruiz de Montoya, who wrote the
vocabulary, and tried to adapt the language to grammatical principles
and rules.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the numerous notes I have placed at the foot of the pages, I have
corrected the errors of Guaraní nomenclature committed by Schmidt,
whenever they bear some resemblance to the true names of tribes and
places referred to. Some errors were noticed by L. Hulsius (or Hulse) in
1599, who indicated those of well-known places and names, which in the
first German edition appeared disfigured. For instance, "Demerieffe"
for "Tenerife", and "Petrus Manchossa" for "Don Pedro de Mendoza". But
neither Hulsius nor the other editors could correct them accurately,
because they did not know a single word of the language of the natives,
nor of that of their Spanish conquerors. These errors are still greater
in the Latin version from which the Spanish and other translations were
made.

The errors of Schmidt went so far in names of persons that he did not
write correctly those of his chiefs, not even that of Domingo Martinez
de Irala, under whose immediate orders he served for twenty years.
Schmidt repeatedly insists on naming him Martino Domingo de Eyollas.
Another of his chiefs was Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, whom he always
names Abernunzo Cabessa de Bacha. The most curious thing is, that the
editors who attempted to correct these errors, were not free from
similar faults; even M. Camus,[8] who, in correcting that of Cabeza
de Vaca, rendered it by Alvare Nugnez Cabera di Vacha; and M. Ternaux
Compans, who supposed the settlement named "Duechkamin" by Schmidt,
to be Tucuman,[9] because he did not know that neither the city nor
the province of this name were founded at the moment to which he is
referring.

I believe that in my notes I have removed all these blunders, leaving
some of them as they are, because they are incomprehensible and have no
importance for history or geography.

In all this, and in chronology, the work of Schmidt is extremely
defective, so much so, that I am unable to understand how the Spanish
geographer Azara, recommending the merits of this adventurer, should
have affirmed the following enormity in his _Voyages dans l'Amérique
Méridionale_:--"Je fais grand cas de ce petit ouvrage, a cause de son
impartialité et de l'exactitude des distances et des situations, choses
en quoi personne ne l'égale."[10] I do not accept this judgment, and in
my notes and observations the reader will see if I have good reason for
differing from Azara, whose merits I recognise, as I also know his grave
faults.

  [10] _Voyages dans l'Amérique Méridionale_, par Don Felix Azara;
  Paris, 1809; Introduction, p. 20.

Azara is one of the few who deny that the country was inhabited by
a multitude of various nations, as many writers have asserted, and
nevertheless enumerates and describes no less than thirty-two nations
and more than fifty tribes. I maintain there was only one nation, the
Guaraní; and in the province of La Plata, described by Alvar Nunez
and by Schmidt, the Guaranís were divided into twenty-one tribes, who
differed only in their habits, or their arms, or in the nature of
the country inhabited by them. These are the tribes entered on my
ethnographical map. The others, mentioned by the writers in question,
would be merely unimportant groups, designated by the name of their
chief, or by some nickname applied to them by their neighbours or
enemies. The tribes I record are the following: Quîrandís, Chanás,
Charuas, Yarós, Arechanés, Minhuános, Timbús, Tobas, Mocobís or Mbocoys,
Abipones, Agaces, Mepenes, Mbaiás, Payaguás, Guaicurús, Cheriguanos,
Xarayos, Itatines, Guatós, Cariyós, Tapiis; all these are Guaranís. I do
not treat of the other principal tribes, situated in the interior of the
country between Paraná and the Andes, because they do not concern the
narratives of Schmidt and Alvar Nunez.

       *       *       *       *       *

To the errors of Schmidt in nomenclature and distances must be added
others of fact, doubtless more important. These also are rectified
in the notes, which the reader will find in the corresponding place.
In these, however, I have not touched on the subject of cannibalism
attributed to the natives, because this deserves separate treatment
here.

I believe there is not a single author of history and travel, at the
time of the conquest of America, who has not admitted the assertion,
and repeated it, that the natives were _anthropophagi_. Even the name
_cannibals_ was invented in the early years of the conquest. When
Christopher Columbus established himself in Hayti, he asked the feeble,
unarmed, and hospitable Indians he found there, for some information
concerning other islands and their inhabitants, and they informed him
that further on there were perverse men who made war upon them to rob
and enslave them. These Indians of Hayti gave the name of _Carib_ and
_Caniba_ to the islands inhabited by their enemies, called _Caribes_.

Columbus says, in the unique autograph document that is known concerning
his first voyage of discovery,[11] that these Indians are held in all
the islands to be very fierce, and that they eat _live flesh_ (_carne
viva_). He considers them, however, on the whole, equal to the others.
This is the first origin of the tale of cannibalism, for the letter of
Columbus, in which this statement is made, was immediately translated
into Latin and published at Rome, and in this translation the Spanish
words, _comer carne viva_, were interpreted by the Latin phrase, _carne
humana vescuntur_. Long afterwards (from 1527 to 1559) the celebrated
Bartholomé de las Casas wrote his _Historia de las Indias_, in which
he gave an abstract of the journal of Columbus' first voyage. In his
summary, Las Casas relates what Columbus says, amplifying, correcting,
or abridging, as he found convenient; and there the great discoverer
appears repeatedly speaking of Indians who ate human flesh.

  [11] Letter of the Admiral Christopher Columbus to Luis de Santángel,
  Contador Mayor de los Reyes Catholicos. (Navarrete _Coleccion de
  Viages_, tomo i, p. 167.) An identical letter was addressed by
  Columbus to the Contador Rafael Sanchez.

This alteration of the text of the letter of Columbus was repeated by
the conquistadores and missionaries to justify the enslaving of
the Indians and the horrible cruelty with which they were treated,
commending in this way their perils and their labours in the military
and spiritual conquest.

Cannibalism, under its name of _Anthropophagy_, originated with the
fable of Polyphemus, and I am convinced that it is a calumny spread
abroad from the time of Saint Jerome, when this brutality was attributed
to the Scotch, down to the present day, when it is asserted that there
are cannibals in Oceania and Africa.

I do not say this in defence of the Indians, but for the honour of
human nature, not so bad as the creative genius of poets and authors of
fiction have supposed it to be. That barbarous Indians are treacherous;
that when they slay their enemies they will tear them to pieces and burn
them, is beyond dispute. But that they will eat their flesh is a slander
and a despicable falsehood founded on interested motives. I have yet to
find the man who will tell me in good faith he has seen the Indians eat
human flesh. Schmidt does not say it, nor does Alvar Nunez, nor any
other of the historians of America, though all repeat the tale; and
there are some who, even at the present day, believe that the Fuegians,
those unhappy savages of the extreme south of the continent, are
cannibals.

In my new historical work, shortly to be given to the press, I shall
treat of this interesting subject more at large; for the present I limit
myself to the denial of a deed which I could only credit were I to see
it with my own eyes.

These tales of cannibals and of Amazons, of giants and of pygmies, met
with by certain travellers in unknown countries, are the brilliant
spangles wherewith to dazzle the eyes of the vulgar anxious for marvels,
and disposed to believe that in other parts there are men with tails,
and women warriors who live without men, and monsters which have only
existed in mythology and in fable.

       *       *       *       *       *

I hope the readers of this Introduction, and of the notes, will be
indulgent with respect to style, bearing in mind that what they read is
a translation from the Spanish language in which I write.

I cannot terminate without giving my thanks to Mr. E. Delmar Morgan,
Honorary Secretary of the Hakluyt Society, for the active co-operation
he has afforded me in the preparation of this work.

ULRICH SCHMIDT.


ULRICH SCHMIDT'S voyage to the River Plate was published for the first
time, in a Collection of Voyages, edited by the booksellers, Sebastian
Franck and Sigismund Feyerabend, in the middle of the 16th century, at
Frankfort-on-Main. The title of this collection is:

    "Warhafftige Beschreibunge aller theil der Welt, darinn nicht allein
    etliche alte Landtschafften, Königreich, Provinzen, Insulen, auch
    fürnehme Stedt und Märckte (so denn allen Welt-beschreibern bekant
    seind), mit fleiss beschrieben werden, sondern auch sehr viel neuwe,

    "Durch Sebastian Franck von Wörd, zum ersten an tag geben, jetst
    aber mit sondern fleiss auff ein neuwes vbersehen, vnd in ein
    wolgeformtes Handtbuch verfasset. Anno MDLXVII."

The book of Schmidt appeared in the second part of this collection under
the following title:

    "Warhafftige vnd liebliche Beschreibung etlicher fürnemen
    Indianischen Landtschafften vnd Insulen, die vormals in keiner
    Chronicken gedacht, vnd erstlich in der Schiffart Vlrici Schmidts
    von Straubingen, mit grosser gefahr erkündigt, vnd von ihm selber
    auffs fleissigst beschrieben vnd dargethan."

The next edition was published, in 1599, by de Bry in his great
collection known as _Grands et Petits Voyages_, which appeared in German
and Latin. The Latin title is:

    "Collectiones Peregrinationum in Indiam Occidentalem et in Indiam
    Orientalem 25 partibus comprehensa a Theodoro, Joann Theodoro de
    Bry, et a Math. Merian publicata. Francofurti et Oppenheimii, De Bry
    et Merian, 1590, 1634. America Pars VII.--_Schmidel_, Verissima et

    Illustrata vero pulcherrimis imaginibus, et in lucem emissa, studio

    Anno Christi M.D.XCIX."

First edition, Frankfort, 1599; and second edition (three plates printed
in the text), 1625.

The title of the German abridged edition of de Bry's collection is:

    "America, das ist Erfindung vnd Offenbahrung der Newen Weldt,
    deroselbigen Völcker Gestalt, Sitten, Gebräuch, Policey vnd
    Gottesdienst, in dreissig vornehmtste Schiffahrten kürtzlich vnd

                                                      Anno MDCXVII."

In 1598 Levinus Hulsius had begun to publish his great collection of
voyages, entitled:

    "Sammlung von 26 schiffahrten in verschiedene fremde Länder durch
    Lev. Hulsium und einige andere aus dem Holländischen ins Deutsche
    übersetz und mit allerhand Anmerkungen versehen."

                       Frankfort, Nurnberg, Oppenheim and Hanover,
                                      1598 to 1660.

Schmidt's voyage appeared in this collection, in 1599, under this title:

    "Warhafftige Historien Einer Wunderbaren Schiffart, welche Vlrich
    Schmidel von Straubing, von _anno_ 1534 biss _anno_ 1554, _in
    Americam_ oder Newenwelt bey _Brasilia_ und _Rio della Plata_
    gethan. Was er in diesen Neuntsehen Jahren aussgestanden vnd was
    für seltsame Wunderbare Länder vnd Leuter gesehen: durch ermelten

    dessgleichen mit einer nothwendigen Landtaffel, Figuren vnd anderer
    mehr Erklerung, gezieret Durch Levinvm Hulsivm. _Noriberga, Impensis
    L. H._ 1599."

This book was reprinted by Hulsius in 1602 at Nurnberg, and in 1612 at
Frankfort-on-Main.

There are 16 plates in the British Museum copy, but the map and two
plates are missing. In this edition, dedicated to Johann Philip, Bishop
of Bamberg, the following epilogue occurs: "And so after the lapse of
twenty years, through the special grace and providence of Almighty God,
I have returned to the place whence I set out; but meanwhiles I have in
my peregrination of these Indian nations experienced no little danger to
body and life, great hunger and misery, care and anxiety, sufficiently
made known and set forth in this historical narrative. I say therefore
let praise, honour and thanks be given to Almighty God who has helped
me to come back once more so happily to the place whence I full twenty
years before had started."

And in the Latin edition of this same collection, a new version of
Schmidt's book was published under this title:

    "Vera historia admiranda cujusdam navigationis quam Huldericus
    Schmidel, Straubiugensis, ab anno 1534 usque ad annum 1554 in
    Americam vel novum mundum justa Brasiliam et Rio della Plata
    confecit, quid per hoce annos 19 sustinuerit, quam varias et quam
    mirandas regiones at homines viderit. Ab ipso Schmidelio Germanice
    descripta: nunc vero, emendatis et correctis urbium, regionum et
    fluminum, nominibus, Adjecta etiam tabula geographica, figuris et
    aliis notationibus quibusdam in hanc formam reducta. Noriberga,
    1599. Impensis Levini Hulsii."  4to.

In 1707 a Dutch translation was published at Leyden in the collection of
the bookseller Van der Aa, entitled:

    "Naaukeurige versameling der gedenk-waardigste Reysen na Oost en
    West-Indien, mitsgaders andere Gewesten gedaan; Zedert Jaarhet 1535
    tot 1541, _Te Leyden, door Pieter van der Aa_, 1706-7."  Fol. and
    small 8vo.

Schmidt's voyage appears in vol. 48 of the smaller edition under this
title:

    "Gedenkwaardige Scheeps-Togten na Rio de la Plata in't Zuyderdeel
    van America, en Verscheydene andere voorname Americaanische
    Landschoppen, verrigt onder der Spaanschen Admiraal Pedro de
    Mendoza, Anno 1535, en de Volgende Jaren.... Bescheven door Ulrich
    Schmidt van Straubingen.... Nu aldeerst uyt't Hoogduytsch vertaald."

The first edition in the Spanish language of the book of Schmidt
appeared in the first volume of the collection entitled: _Historiadores
primitivos de las Indias Occidentales, que juntó, tradujo en parte,
y sacó á luz, ilustrados con eruditas notas y copiosos indices, Don
Andreas Gonzalez de Barcia_. 3 vol., fol., Madrid, 1749. It is entitled:

    "Historia y descubrimiento del Rio de la Plata y Paraguay."
    (Translated from the Latin edition of Hulsius.)

This version of Barcia was reprinted, with all his notes, in the third
volume of the _Coleccion de obras y documentos relativos á la Historia
antigua y moderna de las provincias del Rio de la Plata, ilustrados con
notas y disertaciones_, by Pedro de Angelis.--Buenos Aires, 1835-37. 6
vols., fol. The title of Schmidt's book in this collection is:

    "Viaje al Rio de la Plata y Paraguay, por Ulderico Schmidel," 1836.

A French translation of the Latin edition of Hulsius was published
in 1837 in the collection entitled _Voyages, Relations et Mémoires
originaux pour servir a l'histoire de la découverte de l'Amérique,
publiés pour la premiere fois en français_, par H.
Ternaux-Compans.--Paris, 1837-41, 20 vols., 8vo.

The work of Schmidt is in the first volume, under this title:

    "Histoire véritable d'un voyage curieux fait par Ulrich Schmidel, de
    Straubing, dans l'Amérique ou le Nouveau Monde, par le Brésil, et le
    Rio de la Plata, depuis l'année 1534 jusqu'en 1554, ou l'on verra
    tout ce qu'il a souffert pendant ces dix-neuf ans, et la description

    écrit par lui-meme, et publié de nouveau apres corrections des noms
    de villes, de pays et de rivieres."

ALVAR NUNEZ CABEZA DE VACA.


THE first edition of this important narrative of the Adelantado Alvar
Nunez was published at Valladolid in 1555, in one small 4to. volume,
together with his account of his travels and shipwrecks in Florida,
which had been edited some years before. The general title of this book
is:

    "La relacion y comentarios del gobernador Alvar Nunez Cabeça de
    Vaca, de lo acaecido en las dos jornadas que hizo á las Indias."
    Valladolid, 1555. 1 vol. Small 4to.

The second part of this book is entitled:

    "Comentarios de Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, por Pedro Hernandez,
    escribano del Adelantado."

The second edition of the _Comentarios_ is in the second volume of
_Historiadores Primitivos_, by Barcia. Madrid, 1749.

The third edition is in the _Biblioteca de Autores Espanoles_, by
Rivadeneyra, vol. 22. Madrid, 1863.

Ternaux-Compans published a translation into French in the third volume
of his _Voyages et Relations_. Paris, 1837-41.

THE MAP.


The dividing line between Spanish and Portuguese territories in the
accompanying map differs only in one-and-a-half or two degrees of
longitude from that drawn by M. Adolpho de Varnhagen in his _Historia
Geral do Brazil_. The question about the present boundary of those
territories has been settled by modern treaties.

It must also be remarked that the boundaries of the ancient _Province
of Rio de la Plata_, in 1534, were very soon modified by the Spanish
Government, who did the same thing by the four other Provinces into
which the Continent of South America south of the equator was divided
in that year.

  A true and agreeable description of some principal Indian
     lands and islands, which have not been recorded in
        former chronicles, but have now been first
            explored amid great danger during
               the voyage of ULRICH SCHMIDT
                  OF STRAUBING, and most
                    carefully described
                          by him.


IN the first place, when setting forth from Antorff,[12] I came in
fourteen days to Hispania, to a town called Calles,[13] to which one
reckons four hundred miles by sea. I saw before that town a balena, or
whale, thirty-five paces long, out of which thirty tuns--of the capacity
of herring tuns--of fat had been extracted.

  [12] Antwerp.

  [13] Cadiz.

Near the said town of Calles there were fourteen great ships, well
provided with all ammunitions and necessaries, which intended to voyage
to Riodellaplata[14] in India. Also there were two thousand five
hundred Spaniards and one hundred and fifty Germans, Netherlanders, and
Saxons.[15] And our chief captain was called Petrus Manchossa.[16]

  [14] Rio de la Plata.

  [15] Antonio de Herrera (_Historia General de los Hechos de los
  Castellanos en las Islas y Tierra Firme del Mar Oceano_, Madrid,
  1601-1616, viii, 5), who is the official authority, says that Don
  Pedro de Mendoza's expedition was composed of 800 men, very good and
  distinguished people, and eleven ships. Others state that there were
  1,500 and 1,700 men. Schmidt alone states the number as 2,650. By his
  contract with the Government, Mendoza was bound to take with him one
  thousand men in two voyages.

  [16] Don Pedro de Mendoza.

Among these fourteen ships, one belonged to Messrs. Sebastian Neidhart
and Jacob Welser, from Nürnberg, who had sent their factor, Heinrich
Paeime, with merchandise to Riodellaplata. With these and others, as
Germans and Netherlanders, about eighty men, armed with arquebuses and
muskets, I went to Riodellaplata.

As we were now come there,[17] we set out from Sibylla[18] with the said
gentlemen and the chief captain, in the aforesaid year, on the day of
S. Bartholomew, and came to a town in Spain called S. Lucas[19] which is
twenty miles' distance from Sibylla. There we were compelled, on account
of much blustering winds, to stay till the first of September of the
year before-named (1534).

  [17] _i.e._, to Spain.

  [18] Seville.

  [19] San Lucar.

And when we departed from there we fell in with three islands, which lie
near to one another, the first of which is called Demerieff, the other
Kumero, the third Palman,[20] and from the town of S. Lucas to these
islands there is a space of about twenty miles.[21] At these islands the
ships parted company. These islands belong to their Imperial Majesties,
and are inhabited only by Spaniards, with their wives and children. And
there sugar is made. We came with three ships to Palman, and remained
there for four weeks, replenishing our store of victual.

  [20] Teneriffe, Gomera, and Palma, three of the Canary Islands.

  [21] From San Lucar to the Canary Islands there are about 500 English
  miles.

But afterwards our chief captain, Petrus Manchossa, being at a distance
of eight to nine miles from us, and having commanded us to make sail, we
having on board our ship our captain's cousin, Jörg Manchossa,[22]
who had fallen in love with the daughter of a burgher of Palma, and
inasmuch as we were going to leave on the following day, the said Jörg
Manchossa went ashore that very night, at twelve o'clock, with twelve of
his good companions, and brought secretly with them, out of the island
Palma, the said burgher's daughter and her maid-servant, with all their
clothes and jewels, and money also, and came aboard again, but secretly,
to the intent that neither our captain, nor the aforesaid agent, nor
anybody else on the ship might know aught about it; only the watch saw
them, for it was about midnight. And as we were intending to depart
from there in the morning, and were only about two or three miles away,
a mighty wind sprang up, so that we needs must turn back to the same
harbour, where we were lying before. When we there cast anchor, our
captain, the aforesaid Heinrich Paine, would go aland in a small vessel,
which is called pat or podell (_bote_). And as he went, and was about
to land, there were awaiting him more than thirty men, armed with
arquebuses, spears, and halberds with the intention of taking him, the
said Heinrich Paine. At the same time one of his crew besought him not
to land, but to return to the ship, which advice the captain would have
gladly followed, but that he could not, seeing that the men on land
had come too near to him in another little ship, which they had in
readiness; however, he escaped at length in another ship which was near
the land. When the armed men saw that the others did not fire upon, nor
could take the captain Heinrich Paine, they caused the town of Palma to
sound the alarm, swiftly loaded two great guns, and fired four shots at
our ship (which lay not far off from the land). With the first shot they
breached our earthen pot, which was on the poop and full of fresh water,
whereby five or six pails of water were lost. Secondly, they shot in
pieces also the mizzen, that is, the hindmost mast nearest the stern.
Thirdly, they shot in the waist of the ship a big hole whereby a man was
struck and killed. But with the fourth shot they missed us.

  [22] Jorge de Mendoza. No known document mentions this Jorge de
  Mendoza, nor the rape alluded to by Schmidt. It is not likely that a
  relative of the chief of the expedition should have been on board a
  Flemish ship which was not under his immediate command.

There was also another captain, whose ship was lying by our side, and
who intended to sail for Nova Hispania, in Mechseckheim[23]; he was on
shore with one hundred and fifty men, who, when he knew of our quarrel,
made peace between us and those of the town, on condition that Jörg
Manchossa[24] and the burgher's daughter and her maid-servant should
certainly be delivered into their hands.

  [23] Mexico.

  [24] Jorge de Mendoza.

Then the stadthalter, and the judge, our captain, and the captain
spoken of above, came aboard our ship, intending to make prisoners Jörg
Manchossa and his paramour.[25] Thereupon he answered them that she was
his wife, and she did not show herself in another light and they soon
got married; the father, however, was very sorry and anxious, and our
ship was through them badly treated by the firing at it. After all this,
we left Jörg Manchossa and his wife ashore, for our captain would not
have them any longer on board his ship.

  [25] In orig.: "Bulschafft," lit. love intrigue.

Now we again made ready our ship, and sailed to an island or land, the
name whereof is S. Jacob, or, in Spanish, Sancte Augo (Santiago); there
is a town belonging to the King of Portugal; the Portuguese entertain
that town, and the Blackamoors are their subjects: this town is at a
distance of three hundred miles from the said Island Palman, from which
we sailed.[26] We remained there five days, and again furnished our
ship with new and fresh victual, as bread, meat, water, and all that
necessity demands at sea. The whole fleet, namely, fourteen ships, were
now once more together. We then went again to sea and sailed for two
whole months, and then arrived at an island wherein there was nothing
else than birds, in such quantities that we killed them with sticks.
Here we lay three days. This island is entirely uninhabited; it is in
length and breadth about six miles either way, and is distant from the
above-mentioned island, _S. Augo_, whence we sailed, fifteen hundred
miles. In this sea there are flying-fishes and other marvellous great
fishes of the balena kind, and great fishes called _schaubhut_, for that
they wear on their heads a large trencher, with which they may become
dangerous in fighting with other fishes; it is a wondrous great and evil
fish. There are also other fishes which have on their backs a knife of
whalebone, and are called in the Spanish tongue _Peschespate_,[27] and
furthermore, other fishes which have on their backs a saw of whalebone,
and are also evil fishes; their name is _Peschedeferre_,[28] and also
there are several other rare fishes whose form, size, and other features
I cannot at this time describe.

  [26] All distances given by Schmidt are erroneous, and it is
  astonishing that Don Felix de Azara, a geographer, should have written
  to the contrary. By the distance given in miles between Palma, one of
  the Canary Islands, and St. Iago, one of the Cape Verd Islands, it may
  be seen that Schmidt's miles are more properly _Castilian leagues_ of
  171 in a geographical degree, the legal measure of distance in his
  time.

  [27] Peje-espada, or sword-fish.

  [28] Peces-sierras.

Afterwards we sailed from this island to another, named Riogenea,[29] at
a distance of five hundred miles from the former, belonging to the King
of Portugal; this is the island Riogenea in India, and the Indians
are called Toppis.[30] We lay there about fourteen days. There Petrus
Manchossa,[31] our chief captain, ordered Hans Ossorig,[32] as his sworn
brother, to take the command over us in his stead, forasmuch as he was
always melancholy, weak, and ill. But he, Hans Ossorig, very soon was
belied and ill-spoken of to Petrus Manchossa, his sworn brother, even
as though he had in his mind to cause a mutiny among the people against
Petrus Manchossa, the chief captain. Thereupon he, Petrus Manchossa,
ordered four other captains, named Johann Eyollas, Johan Salleisser,
Jörg Luchsam,[33] and Lazarum Salvaischo,[34] that the aforesaid Johan
Ossorig should be killed with a dagger or otherwise put to death, and
should be exposed in the midst of the place as a traitor; and besides
he ordered and proclaimed to the effect that no one should dare to pity
Ossorig, for that he himself, whoever he might be, would meet with no
better fate. Yet Ossorig was treated wrongly, God Almighty knows it, and
may He be merciful to him, for he was a pious, fair-dealing, and valiant
warrior, and kept well all the warriors.

  [29] The discoverers were Spaniards, and this is proved by the name
  _Rio de Henero_, as the word _Enero_ was spelt in the sixteenth
  century. The _h_ was at the time aspirated (especially by the natives
  of Andalusia), and hence the name became corrupted into _Jenero_,
  changed afterwards into _Janeiro_ by the Portuguese.

  [30] Tupys.

  [31] Don Pedro de Mendoza.

  [32] Juan Osorio.

  [33] Juan de Ayolas, Juan Salazar, and Jorge Lujan.

  [34] If this name is rightly spelt, it may be one of the Flemish
  who took part in the expedition. In Barcia's Spanish translation,
  Salvaischo is interpreted as Salazar; but there is no mention in any
  document of a Lazaro Salazar.

From there we sailed to Riodellaplata, and came into a river[35] called
Paranau Wassu,[36] which is in width at its mouth, where one leaves the
sea,[37] twenty-four miles. And from Riogenea to this river there is the
space of five hundred miles. There we came to a haven, the name whereof
is S. Gabriel, and there, in the said river Paranau, we anchored the
fourteen ships.

  [35] In orig.: "süss fliessend wasser."

  [36] Parana Guazú.

  [37] Between Cape Santa Maria and Cape San Antonio there are 188
  English geographical miles.

As we were constrained to ride at a gunshot's distance from shore with
the great ships, our chief captain, Petrus Manchossa[38] ordered to
set the people ashore in the small ships, which are for that purpose
intended, and are, therefore, called pat or podel.

  [38] Don Pedro de Mendoza.

So by the grace of God we arrived at Riodellaplata, Anno 1535, and found
there an Indian place inhabited by about two thousand people, named
Zechurias,[39] who have nothing to eat but fish and meat. These, on
our arrival did leave the place, and fled away with their wives and
children, so that we could not find them. This Indian people go quite
naked, the women having only their privities covered, from the navel to
the knees, with a small piece of cotton cloth.

  [39] Charúas.

Now the captain, Petrus Manchossa, commanded to bring the people into
the ships again, and to convey them to the other side of the Paranau,
where it is not broader than eight miles.[40]

  [40] From the Island of San Gabriel to the place where Buenos Ayres
  was founded there are 29 English miles.

There we built a new town and called it _Bonas Aeieres_, that is, in
German, _Guter Wind_.

We also brought from Hispania on board the fourteen ships seventy-two
horses and mares.

Here, also, we found a place inhabited by Indian folk, named
Carendies,[41] numbering about three thousand people, including wives
and children, and they were clothed in the same way as the Zechurias,
from the navel to the knees. They brought us fish and meat to eat. These
Carendies have no houses, but wander about, as do the Gipsies with us at
home, and in summer they oftentimes travel upwards of thirty miles on
dry land without finding a single drop of water to drink.

  [41] Quirandis.

And when they meet with deer or other wild beasts, (when they have
killed them) they drink their blood. Also if they find a root, called
Cardes,[42] they eat it to slack their thirst. This--namely, that they
drink blood--only happens because they cannot have any water, and that
they might peradventure die of thirst.

  [42] Cardo, _i.e._, thistles.

These Carendies brought us daily their provision of fish and meat to our
camp, and did so for a fortnight, and they did only fail once to come to
us. So our captain, Peter Manchossa,[43] sent to them, the Carendies,
a judge, named Johan Pabon, with two foot-soldiers, for they were at a
distance of four miles from our camp. When they came near to them, they
were all three beaten black and blue, and were then sent back again
to our camp. Petrus Manchossa, our captain, hearing of this from the
judge's report (who for this cause raised a tumult about it in our
camp), sent Diego Manchossa, his own brother, against them with three
hundred foot-soldiers and thirty well-armed mounted men, of whom I also
was one, straightway charging us to kill or take prisoners all these
Indian Carendies and to take possession of their settlement. But when
we came near them there were now some four thousand men, for they had
assembled all their friends. And when we were about to attack them, they
defended themselves in such a way that we had that very day our hands
full. They also killed our commander, Diego Manchossa, and six noblemen.
Of our foot-soldiers and mounted men over twenty were slain, and on
their side about one thousand. Thus did they defend themselves valiantly
against us, so that indeed we felt it.

  [43] Don Pedro de Mendoza.

The said Carendies[44] use for their defence hand-bows and tardes[45]
which are made in the shape of half-pikes, and the head of them is made
out of flint-stone, like a flash; they have also bullets made out of
stone with a long piece of string attached to them, of the size of our
leaden bullets at home in Germany.

  [44] Quirandis.

  [45] Darts.

They throw such bullets round the feet of a horse or a deer, causing it
to fall; it is also with these bullets that they killed our commander
and the noblemen, as I have seen it done myself, but the foot-soldiers
were killed by the aforesaid tardes.

Thus God Almighty graciously gave us the victory, and allowed us to
take possession of their place; but we did not take prisoner any of the
Indians, and their wives and children also fled away from the place
before we attacked them.[46] At this place of theirs we found nothing
but furrier-work made from marten or so-called otter; also much fish,
fish meal, and fish fat. There we remained three days and then returned
to our camp, leaving on the spot one hundred of our men, in order that
they might fish with the Indians' nets for the providing of our folk,
because there was there very good fishing.

  [46] This fight with the Quirandis took place at a few miles' distance
  from Buenos Ayres, on the banks of the river which since then is
  called _de la Matanza_.

Every one received only six half-ounces of wheaten flour a day, and one
fish every third day. The fishing lasted for two months, and if one
would eat a fish over and above one's allowance, one had to go four
miles for it.

And when we returned again to our camp, our folk were divided into those
who were to be soldiers, and the others workers, so as to have all of
them employed. And a town was built there, and an earthern wall, half
a pike high, around it, and inside of it a strong house for our chief
captain. The town wall was three foot broad, but that which was built
to-day fell to pieces the day after, for the people had nothing to eat,
and were starved with hunger, so that they suffered great poverty, and
it became so bad that the horses could not go. Yea, finally, there was
such want and misery for hunger's sake, that there were neither rats,
nor mice, nor snakes to still the great dreadful hunger and unspeakable
poverty, and shoes and leather were resorted to for eating and
everything else.

It happened that three Spaniards stole a horse, and ate it secretly,
but when it was known, they were imprisoned and interrogated under the
torture. Whereupon, as soon as they admitted their guilt, they were
sentenced to death by the gallows, and all three were hanged.

Immediately afterwards, at night, three other Spaniards came to the
gallows to the three hanging men, and hacked off their thighs and pieces
of their flesh, and took them home to still their hunger.

A Spaniard also ate his brother, who died in the city of Bonas
Aeieres.[47]

  [47] All this is exaggerated and incredible, though accepted as true
  by the pseudo-poet, Barco Centenera, in his _Argentina_ poem.

Now our chief captain, Petrus Manchossa,[48] saw that he could not any
longer keep his men there, so he ordered and took counsel with his head
men that four little ships (called Parchkadienes[49]) should be made
ready, which must he rowed, and three more yet smaller ones, which are
called podell or patt.

  [48] Pedro de Mendoza.

  [49] Brigantines.

And when these seven little vessels were ready and equipped, our
chief captain ordered all the people to assemble, and sent George
Lauchstein[50] with three hundred and fifty armed men up the river
Paranau in order to find out the Indians and so obtain victual and
provisions. But as soon as the Indians were aware of us, they wrought
us the most abominable piece of knavery, by burning and destroying all
their victual and provisions and their villages, and then all took to
flight; in consequence whereof we had nothing to eat but three ounces
of bread a day. One half of our people died during this voyage through
hunger, therefore we had to return again to the said place, where was
our chief captain.

  [50] George Lujan.

Petrus Manchossa desired to have a relation from George Lauchstein, our
commander, as to the circumstances of our voyage, why so few of them had
returned, since they had only been absent for five months. To whom our
commander answered thus: the people died for hunger, since the Indians
burnt all the provisions, and then took to flight, as has been related
before.

After all this we remained still another month together in great poverty
in the town of Bonas Aeieres, until the ships were prepared.

At this time the Indians came in great power and force, as many as
twenty-three thousand men, against us and our town Bonas Aeieres. There
were four nations of them, namely, Carendies, Zechurias, Zechuas, and
Diembus.[51] They all meant to go about to destroy us all. But God
Almighty preserved the greater part of us, therefore praise and thanks
be to Him always and everlastingly, for on our side not more than about
thirty men, including commanders and ensign, were slain.

  [51] Quirandis, Charúas, and Timbus.

And when they first came to our town, Bonas Aeieres, and attacked us,
some of them tried to storm the place, others shot fiery arrows at our
houses, which, being covered with straw (only the house of our chief
captain, covered with tiles, excepted), were set on fire, and so the
whole town was burnt down. Their arrows are made out of cane, and carry
fire on their points.

They have also a kind of wood, out of which they also make arrows,
which, being lighted and shot off, do not extinguish, but also set fire
to all houses made out of straw.

Moreover they burnt down four great ships which were half-a-mile distant
from us on the river. The people who were there, and who had no guns,
hearing such great tumult of the Indians, fled out of these four ships
into three others which were not far from these, and did contain cannon.

But seeing the four ships burning that were lighted by the Indians,
the Christians set themselves on defence and fired at the Indians, who
becoming aware of this, and hearing the firing, soon departed from
thence and left the Christians alone. All this happened on St. John's
Day, Anno 1535.

All this having thus happened, our people had to return into the ships
again, and Petrus Manchossa,[52] our chief captain, gave the command to
Johann Eyollas,[53] and put him in his place to be our commander and
rule us. But when Eyollas mustered the people, he found no more than
five hundred and sixty men who were yet alive, out of two thousand five
hundred, the others being dead and having been starved for hunger. God
Almighty be gracious and merciful to them and to us. Amen.

  [52] Don Pedro de Mendoza.

  [53] Juan de Ayolas.

Johann Eyollas, our commander, now ordered eight small ships,
Parchkadienes and Podells, to be made ready, and took with him on these
ships four hundred men out of the five hundred and sixty, leaving the
others, namely, one hundred and sixty men, in the four great ships to
guard them, and he gave them a commander, named Johann Romero, and left
them victual for one year, so that each soldier might have four ounces
of bread or flour daily; he who wanted more was at liberty to find it.

When all this had been done and arranged as here described, Johann
Eyollas[53] and the four hundred men sailed with the Parchkadienes and
the Podells[54] up the river Paranau, and Petrus Manchossa,[52] our chief
captain, sailed with us, and in two months' time we reached the Indians,
at a distance of eighty-four miles. These people are called Tyembus[55];
they wear on either nostril a small star, made out of white and blue
stones. The men are tall of stature and erect, but the women, on the
contrary, young and old, are very deformed, having all the lower part of
their faces scratched, and always bloody. These people have nothing else
to eat, and have all their lives through lived upon nothing else but
fish and meat. They are reckoned to be fifteen thousand strong, or more.
And when we came to about four miles' distance from this people they
took notice of us, and came to meet us in sign of peace, with over four
hundred canoes, in each of which were sixteen men.

  [54] Brigantines and boats.

  [55] Timbus.

Such a skiff is made out of a single tree, eighty feet long and three
feet wide, and must be rowed as the fishermen's boats in Germany, only
that the oars are not bound with iron.

When we met them on the water, our commander, Johann Eyollas, presented
the chief of the Tyembus Indians, Zchera Wassu,[56] with a shirt, a red
cap, a hatchet, and several other things. After this, Zchera Wassu went
with us to their place, and gave us there fish and meat in abundance.

  [56] Chera Guazú.

But if this said journey of ours had lasted ten more days, we would
all have died of hunger, for even without that, fifty men out of four
hundred who came in the ships had already died on this journey. But in
this danger God mercifully helped us, be He praised and thanked for it.

In this said place we abode four years, but our chief captain, Petrus
Manchossa,[57] who was full of infirmities, and was unable to move his
hands or his feet, and who had spent during this voyage forty thousand
ducats of his own in cash, could not remain any longer with us, and he
sailed off in two small Parchkadienes to Bonas Aeieres to the four great
ships, and took two of them with fifty men and sailed for Hispania. But
when he was come nearly half-way, the hand of the Almighty so smote him
that he died miserably. May God be merciful to him!

  [57] Pedro de Mendoza.

But before his departure he had promised us to send two other ships
to Riodellaplata, as soon as he himself or the ships should arrive in
Spain, and this was faithfully laid down in his will. Accordingly, when
the two ships arrived in Spain, and the councillors of His Imperial
Majesty were informed of this, they speedily, in the name of His
Majesty, sent two ships with people, provisions, and merchandise, and
all necessaries, to Riodellaplata.

The commander of these two ships was called Alvanzo Gabrero,[58] who
brought with him also about two hundred Spaniards and provisions for two
years. He arrived at Bonas Aeieres (where the two other ships had been
left) in the year 1539, with one hundred and sixty men.

  [58] Alonso Cabrera.

The said commander, Alvanzo Gabrero, having come to the island Thiembus,
to our chief, Johann Eyollas,[59] they ordered a ship to be sent to
Spain, according to the will and order of the councillors of His
Imperial Majesty, in order to report to them how all things were
situated there in that country.

  [59] Juan de Ayolas.

Then Johann Eyollas, our chief captain, held a council with Alvanzo
Gabrero and Martin Domingo Eyolla,[60] and some other of his officers,
and it was resolved to muster the men. And this being done, it was found
that, together with those who had come from Spain, there were five
hundred and fifty men. Of these they took four hundred men to
themselves, leaving the other one hundred and fifty men at Thiembus,
because there were not enough ships. They gave these men a commander,
named Carolus Doberim,[61] who had been for some time page of His
Imperial Majesty.

  [60] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

  [61] Carlos Dubrin.

After this had been resolved, they sailed with these four hundred men
in eight small Parchkadienes up the river Paranau, in order to seek
out another river, called Parabor,[62] where the Carios live, who have
Turkish corn and a root named Mandeochade,[63] and other roots such
as padades[64] and mandeoch parpie, mandioch mandapore, etc. The root
padades resembles an apple, and has the same taste. Mandeoch parpie
have the taste of chestnuts. Wine is made from mandepore,[65] and the
Indians drink it. These Carios have fish and meat and great sheep,
as big as mules. They also have wild boar, ostriches, and other wild
beasts; also very many hens and geese.

  [62] Paraguai.

  [63] Manioc.

  [64] Yams, or sweet potatoes.

  [65] Mandioca or algarroba.

So then departing from the haven of Bonesperanso[66] with the said eight
Parchkadienes vessels, we reached the first day, after a voyage of four
miles, a nation called Curanda,[67] who abstain from fish and meat, and
number over twelve thousand men, all of whom are fit for war. These
people resemble the Thiembus spoken of before; they have little stones
on their noses, and the men are tall, but the women are hideous; young
as well as old have their faces scratched and always bloody. They are
clothed like the Thiembus, from the navel to the knee with a small
cotton cloth, as was described before. These Indians have great plenty
of otter skins; also many canoes or skiffs. They liberally parted
with us their fish, meat, and skins. We gave them in exchange glasses,
paternosters, looking-glasses, combs, knives, and fish-hooks. We
remained there two days, and then they gave us two Carios who were their
captives, to show us the way, and help us with the language.

  [66] Buena Esperanza, also called Corpus Christi, was the name given
  by Don Pedro de Mendoza, says Herrera, to the settlement founded by
  him four old Spanish leagues below the abandoned fort of Sebastian
  Cabot.

  [67] Coronda.

Sailing further we came afterwards to another people called
Gulgaises,[68] who number forty thousand men of war and abstain from
fish and meat. These have also two little stars on their noses; they are
situated thirty miles from the Curandas,[69] and speak the same language
as the Thiembus[70] and Curandas. They dwell on a lake six miles long
and four miles wide, on the left side of the river Paranau.[71] We
stayed four days among them, and these men imparted to us of their
poverty and we did the like by them.

  [68] Guaicurús.

  [69] Quirandis.

  [70] Timbús.

  [71] Paraná.

From thence we sailed further, and during eighteen days we did not find
any people; then we came to a river flowing inland. And there we found a
great multitude of people, called Machkuerendas.[72] These eat nothing
but fish and a little meat, number over eighteen thousand men of war,
and have many canoes or skiffs.

  [72] Perhaps _Mocoretás_. But the Indians living in those parts were
  the Agazes and Abipones. The Timbus and Corondas were the same folk.

They received us well, after their manner, sharing with us of their
poverty; they live on the other side, _i.e._, the right side of the
Paranaw, speak a different language from the former, wear also two
little stars (stones) on their nose, are tall and of a good proportion;
but their women are as hideous as those before spoken of; and they are
distant sixty-seven miles from the Gulgaises.[73]

  [73] Guaicurús.

After having lived among them for four days, we found on the land a
marvellous great and monstrous snake five and twenty foot long, and
as thick as a man, black and yellow in colour, which we fired at and
killed. The Indians marvelled much at seeing such a snake, for they
never before had seen such a large one. This snake, so they told us, had
done much harm to them, for when they were bathing this snake was also
in the water and it would coil its tail around one of them, taking him
under water and devouring him there, so that oftentimes the Indians did
not know what had become of him. I myself carefully measured the length
and thickness of this snake, which the Indians cut up in pieces and
carried home with them, and having boiled and roasted it, did afterwards
eat thereof.

From thence we sailed up the river Paranaw for four days' journey, and
came to a people called Zchemiaisch Saluaischo,[74] who are small and
thick set, and eat nothing but fish and honey. These people, both men
and women, young and old, go about absolutely naked as they came into
the world, so that they have neither linen nor anything else to cover
their privities.

  [74] It is impossible even to guess at what the author means by these
  words, which are not _Guaraní_.

They make war against the Machkuerendas. The flesh they eat consists
of deer, wild swine, ostriches, and rabbits, which resemble rats, but
without tails. This people is at a distance of sixteen miles from the
Machkuerendas, and we made that journey in four days. We only passed the
night among them, for they themselves had nothing to eat. They are just
like our highwaymen or street-robbers at home.

They dwell about twenty miles away from the water, to the intent that
their enemies might not easily fall upon them. But at this time they
had come to the water five days before we did, in order to fish and
to provide themselves because they were about to make war against the
Machkuerendas. They number two thousand men.

We departed thence and came to a people called Mapennis,[75] who number
ten thousand men. These people dwell scattered here and there in that
country, extending for the space of forty miles either way. Yet they can
all be gathered together either on land or water in two days time. They
had more canoes or skiffs than any other people we had seen hitherto,
and in one such canoe they can carry as many as twenty persons.

  [75] Mepenes.

This people received us on the river in a hostile and war-like manner,
with five hundred canoes, but with little profit to themselves from us,
for we slew a goodly number of them with our guns, they having never in
their lives before seen either a gun or a Christian.

But when we came to their houses, we could prevail nothing against them,
seeing that they were a whole mile distant from the river Paranon[76]
where our ships lay; and all their villages were surrounded with deep
water from the lake, so that we could do them no harm, nor take anything
from them, except that we took two hundred and fifty canoes, which we
burnt and destroyed. Neither did we dare to go too far from our ships,
for we feared that they might attack the ships from another side,
therefore we returned. The Mapennis only fight upon the water, and
are distant from the Zchemias Saluaischo, from whom we last came,
ninety-five miles.

  [76] Paraná.

From thence we sailed in eight days to a river called the Parabor[77]
which we ascended and found there a numerous people named
Kueremagbas,[78] having nothing to eat but fish and meat and St. John's
bread,[79] or the herb fenugreek, from which also they make wine.[80]
This people was very kind to us, and gave us every thing of which we
were in need. They are very tall, both men and women.

  [77] Paraguai.

  [78] These Indians are the Mbaiás.

  [79] Algarroba, the seed of the carob tree.

  [80] The vegetable from which they made wine was not the fenugreek,
  but the carrot-bean (Prosopis dulcis mimosa).

The men pierce a little hole in their nose, in which they insert for
ornament a small parrot's feather. The women have long blue stripes on
their cheeks which remain all their lives through, and their privities
are covered with a small piece of cotton cloth from the navel to the
knees. From the Mapennis[81] to these Kueremagbas are forty miles; we
remained three days among them.

  [81] Mepenes.

Departing thence we came to another people called Aygais,[82] who
also live on fish and meat. They are tall and erect. The women are
nice-looking, painted, and have their privities covered in the same
manner as explained before.

  [82] Agazes.

When we came to them, they put themselves on their defence, and wished
to make war against us by not allowing us to pass through. Finding this
to be the case, and that there was no help for it, we put our trust in
God, and then made our preparations to attack them by land and water;
we fought them and killed a great number--fifteen of our men also being
slain. God be merciful to them.

These Aygais are the best warriors that can be found on the water, but
they are not so good at fighting on land. Before fighting, they caused
their wives and children to flee to a place of safety, and concealed
their provisions and other things. What happened to them at the last you
will presently hear. Their place is near a river called Jepedij,[83] on
the other side of the Parabor. It takes its source in the mountains of
Peru, near a town named Duechkamin.[84] From the Kueremagbas to the
Aygais there are thirty miles.

  [83] Ipiti, the name of this river, signifies "red" in the Guaraní
  language; hence the Spaniards called it Rio Bermejo (Red River).

  [84] Neither at the time of Schmidt, nor afterwards, was there at the
  head of the Bermejo a people called Duechkamin. This may, perhaps,
  refer to Tomina, because, though this town is not situated within
  the system of the river Bermejo, it is not far from it, and this
  circumstance may have led Schmidt into error. M. Ternaux says in his
  _Collection_ that this town can be no other than Tucuman, but this
  proves his incompetency in this matter, as Tucuman was founded many
  years after Schmidt's voyage to the River Plate.

Departing from these Aygais we came to a people named Carios, fifty
miles distant from the Aygais. There, by God's grace, we found plenty
of Turkish corn and mandeochade, padades, mandeochparpij, mandepore,
manduris, wacheku, etc. They have also fish and meat, deer, wild boar,
ostriches, Indian sheep, rabbits, hens and geese, also plenty of honey,
of which they make wine; and there is much cotton in the land.

These Carios have a large country, nearly three hundred miles in length
and breadth; they are men of short stature, and more able to endure work
and labour than the other natives.

The men have a little hole in their lips in which they put yellow
crystals, called in their language Parabor,[85] two spans long and of
the thickness of a quill or reed.

  [85] _Parabor._ In Barcia's Spanish translation this word thus written
  by Schmidt was changed into _tembetá_, which was the one used by the
  Tapijs (Tupis). Both are Guaraní words, and they represent the same
  thing; but _parabog_, or rather _paraog_, is more picturesque and
  accurate. It means a cover in various colours.

This people, men and women, young and old, go completely naked as God
created them. Among these Indians, the father sells his daughter, the
husband his wife if she does not please him, and the brother sells or
exchanges his sister. A woman costs a shirt or a bread knife, or a small
hoe, or some other thing of that kind.

These Carios also eat man's flesh if they can get it. For when they make
prisoners in war, male or female, they fatten them as we do swine in
Germany. But if the woman be somewhat young and good-looking, they keep
her for a year or so, and if during that time she does not live after
their desires, they put her to death and eat her, making a solemn
banquet[86] of it, and oftentimes this is combined with a marriage. Only
old persons are put to work until they die.

  [86] In orig.: "Pancket."

These Carios undertake longer journeys than any nation in the country of
the Riodellaplata. They are wonderful warriors on land. Their villages
or towns are situate on hills upon the river Paraboe[87]; formerly their
city was called Lambere.[88]

  [87] Paraguai.

  [88] Lambaré.

Their town is made with two wooden palisades, each piece of timber being
the thickness of a man. And one palisade is separated from the other by
a space of twelve feet; the posts are driven down into the earth, six
feet deep, and are above the earth nearly as high as one may reach with
a sword.

They have also their forts. And at a distance of fifteen feet from this
town wall they made pits as deep as the height of three men, one over
the other, and put into them (but not above ground) lances of hard wood,
with points like that of a needle; and they covered these pits with
straw and small gravel, strewing a little earth and grass between, to
the intent that when we Christians pursued them, or assaulted their
town, we should have fallen blindly into these pitfalls. But at length
they digged so many pits that they themselves fell into them.

For when our chief captain Johann Eijollas[89] commanded all our people,
except sixty men who were left in the Parchkadienes[90] to guard them,
and marched them in good order against their town Lambere, the Carios
descried our approach at a gunshot distance, and they numbered forty
thousand men armed with bows and arquebuses, and they begged us to go
back to our Parchkadienes; if we did so, they would provide us with
victuals and other necessaries, but if not they would act as our
enemies. But it did not suit us nor our chief captain to do this, for
the country and the people pleased us very well, as did also their food,
for we had not seen nor eaten better bread during the last four years,
fish and meat having been our only sustenance.

  [90] Brigantines.

So the Carios took their bows and guns and received us therewith, and
told us that we were welcome, but we refused to do them any harm. On the
contrary, we told them for the third time to keep the peace, and that
we wished to be their friends. But they did not take any notice of our
words, because they had not yet tried our bows and guns. And when we
came near them we fired at them, so that they heard it, and saw their
people fall to the ground, although they saw not any bullet or arrow
or aught else but a hole in their body; and they wondered and were
frightened, and soon all took to flight, and fell one upon another like
dogs. So they hastened to shelter themselves in their town, after two
hundred of them had fallen into the above-mentioned pits.

Afterwards we Christians came to their town and assaulted it, but they
resisted as well as they could for three days. Not being able to hold
out any longer, and fearing besides for their wives and children whom
they had with them in the town, they prayed for mercy, promising that
they would do anything for us if only we would spare their lives. Also
they gave to our commander, Johann Eijollas, six women, the eldest of
whom was only eighteen years old.

They also gave him six deer and other wild beasts, and besought us to
remain with them, and they gave to every soldier two women to wait on
him, and to wash and cook for him. Besides which they gave us food and
all the necessaries of life; so that peace was then concluded between us
and our enemies.

After that the Carios were compelled to build us a great house of stone,
earth, and wood, in order that if in the meanwhile they were to revolt
against us we Christians might have a place of refuge in which to defend
ourselves.

We took this town on the feast of the Assumption, in the year 1539, and
therefore it is called Noster Signora desumsion.[91]

  [91] Nuestra Senora de la Asuncion. Schmidt's chronology is often
  mistaken. Lambaré, with its population, was taken by Juan de Ayolas on
  the 15th of August 1536. Asuncion was founded in the following year by
  Juan de Salazar.

In this skirmish sixteen men fell on our side, and we abode there two
months. These Carios are distant from the Aygais[92] thirty miles,
and from the island Bone Speranso, _i.e._, Good Hope, where the
Thijembus[93] live, about three hundred and fifty-five miles.[94]

  [92] Agazes.

  [93] Timbus.

  [94] Buena Esperanza was situated about lat. S. 32° 33'; Asuncion is
  in 25° 17'.

And so we made a covenant with the Carios, they agreeing and promising
to make war along with us, and to aid us with eight thousand men against
the Aygais.

After our chief captain had decided all this, he took three hundred
Spaniards and these Carios, and went down the river, and afterwards by
land for thirty miles, to a place where the aforesaid Aygais live, of
whom and of their treatment of us we have spoken.

We found them at the same place where we had left them, and we fell upon
them by surprise in their houses while they were asleep, between three
and four o'clock in the morning, for the Carios had sought them out and
watched them, and we killed everybody, young and old, for it is the
custom of the Carios, when they make war and are victorious, to kill all
without any mercy or pity whatsoever.

We took also more than five hundred canoes or skiffs, and we burnt down
all the villages we found, and wrought very much damage besides. Four
months afterwards, some Aygais[95], who had not taken part in this
skirmish, because they were not then at home, came and asked for mercy,
and our commander was obliged to grant it them by order of H. I.
Majesty, who gave orders to pardon every Indian up to the third time,
but if one of them brake the peace for the third time he should become
a prisoner for life or a slave.

  [95] Agazes.

After that we continued for six months in this town, Noster Signora
Desumsion, in German "Unser Frawen Himmelfahrt", and had a good rest.

Then our commander Johann Eijollas[96] inquired of the Carios about a
people called Peijembas,[97] and they answered: it was from this town
Desumsion to the Peijembas[97] one hundred miles distance up the river
Parabol.[98]

  [96] Juan de Ayolas.

  [97] Payaguás.

  [98] Paraguai.

Our commander then asked the Carios how the Peijembas[97] lived, and
what provisions they had, and from what they abstained; also what kind
of people they were, and of their habits. Their answer was, that the
Peijembas[99] had nothing else but fish and meat, and also St. John's
bread and fenugreek.[100] From this fenugreek they make flour which they
eat with their fish; they also make wine of it, and this wine is as
sweet as mead in Germany.

  [99] Payaguás, _vide supra_, p. 15.

  [100] Algarroba.

Our chief captain Johann Eijollas having heard all this from the Carios,
ordered them to load five ships with provisions of Turkish corn and
other things which were in the country; this had to be done in two
months' time, and by that time he and his men would also equip
themselves, and in the first place go to the Peijembas,[99] and
afterwards to a people called Carch Karaisch, and the Carios promised
to be always obedient, and to fulfil in all particulars the captain's
orders.

All things having now been arranged, and the ships provided with
victual, our commander ordered all the people to assemble, and out of
the four hundred men, took three hundred well armed; and the remaining
one hundred were left in the aforesaid town Vardellesse,[101] _i.e._
Noster Signora Desumsion, where the said Carios live. And then we went
up the river and found at a distance of five miles from these Carios a
village on the river Paraboe. The people here brought to us Christians,
victual, in the shape of fish, meat, hens, geese, Indian sheep, and
ostriches.

  [101] _Vardellesse_ must be a Germanized form of the Spanish word
  _Fortaleza_ (fortress).

Coming at last near a village of the Carios, which is called
Weybingen,[102] and is at a distance of eighty miles from Noster Signora
Desumsion, we took from them victual and other things which we could
obtain from them.

  [102] There is no village of that name in Paraguai.

From there we came to a mountain called S. Fernando, which resembles
the Bagenberg; there we found the said Peijembas, who are at twelve
miles distance from Weybingen, and they met us peaceably, and received
us with false hearts, as we shall see hereafter.

They took us into their houses and gave us fish and meat and also
fenugreek, and so we abode there for nine days.

Then our commander sent to ask their chief if they knew a folk named
Carchkareisso.[103] He replied that they knew nothing indeed of such a
people but what they had heard of them by report, and that they dwelt
far away in the country, and that they had much gold and silver, but
that they (the Peijembas) had never seen any of them.

  [103] Guaycurús.

They also told us that these Carchkareisso[103] were wise men, like as
we Christians are, and that they had plenty of victuals, such as Turkish
corn, manioc, manduis, padades, wachekew, mandeochparpü, mandeochade,
mandepare,[104] etc., and several other roots, the flesh of Indian sheep
called amne,[105] an animal resembling a donkey, but that it has feet
like kine and a thick and coarse skin, and that they had plenty also of
deer, rabbits, geese, and hens; but that none of the Peijembas[106] as
has been said, had ever seen all this, but only knew it by report of
others. But we found afterwards how things were situated.

  [104] Manduvis, potatoes, papas, etc.

  [105] Anta, or tapir.

  [106] Payaguás.

Having learned all this, our chief commander required to have some
Peijembas to go with him into that country, whereupon they readily
offered themselves, and presently their chief appointed three hundred
Peijembas to accompany us to carry our victual and other necessaries.
Our commander ordered these people to prepare themselves, for he would
be starting in four days, and of the five ships he ordered three to
sail, and on the other two he left fifty men of us Christians, whom
he ordered to wait there during his five months' absence, and that if
within that space of time he returned not unto us, that we should go
back with these two vessels to Noster Signora Desumsion. But it so
happened that we abode among these Peijembas for six months, and never
heard anything in the meanwhile of our commander Johann Eijolla,[107]
and we grew short of victual, so that we were compelled to return with
our temporary commander Martin Domingo Eijolla[108] to the town Signora,
according to the orders of our chief commander.

  [107] Juan de Ayolas.

  [108] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

How our chief commander Johann Eijollas made his voyage shall be
presently recorded.

First, when he departed from the Peijembas,[109] he came to a folk named
Naperus,[110] who are on friendly terms with the Peijembas; they have
nothing but fish and flesh, and are a people of considerable numbers.
Our commander took with him some of these Naperus to show him the way,
for they were to pass through divers countries, and many nations,
with great difficulty and penury of all things, and meet with much
resistance; so much so that nearly one-half of the Christians died
during this voyage. Finally, when he had come to a people called the
Peijssennas,[111] he could not go any further, but was compelled to turn
back again with all his people except three sick Spaniards, whom he left
among the Peijssennas.

  [109] This word Peiembas is not Guaraní. It must be the _Payaguás_,
  one of the tribes occupying the right bank of the river Paraguay, to
  which Schmidt refers here, or perhaps the _Mbaias_, the tribe adjacent
  to them.

  [110] Yaperús, a tribe of the Payaguás.

  [111] The Peyssennas are the same as the Peiembas. I believe the
  author is referring to the Payaguás.

Our chief commander therefore, Johann Eijollas being _salvo mendo_,
_i.e._ in good health, had come back with his men to the Naperus, where
he stayed until the third day, because the men were faint and overtired
with the journey, and because they had no further supplies.

But the Naperus, understanding this, resolved with the Peijembas, and
made an agreement with them to the effect, that they would kill and
make away with the chief commander Johann Eijollas and all his men, and
they did so afterwards, for when Johann Eijollas was going with his
Christians from the Naperus to the Peijembas, and had gone about
half-way, they were attacked unawares, and with loud cries by the
Naperus and their allies the Peijembas, who fell upon them like mad
dogs, as they were passing through a forest; and they were mercilessly
and miserably slaughtered, sick and faint Christians as they were,
including their commander Johann Eijollas,[112] so that not one of them
escaped. God have mercy on their souls!

  [112] Juan de Ayolas.

Now as we fifty men had gone to the town Noster Signora Desumsion, and
were waiting there for our commander Johann Eijollas and our soldiers,
to know how things had gone, we heard tidings from an Indian who had
been a slave to the late Johann Eijollas, and had been brought by him
from the Peijssennas, and who had escaped because of his knowledge
of the language. But although this man told us minutely all that had
happened from beginning to end, we would not believe him.

And having remained during a whole year in the above-named town, Noster
Signora, we were unable to gather any certain information as to how it
had fared with our soldiers; only the Carios told our commander Martin
Domingo Eijolla[113] that the general report was, that our Christians
had all perished at the hands of the Peijembas.[114] But we would not
yet believe it until we should hear from a Peijemba himself that it
was true. After two months the Carios brought to our commander, Martin
Domingo Eijolla, two Peijembas whom they had taken captive. These
Peijembas being asked if they had really slain them all, denied it most
emphatically, and said that our chief commander and his men were not yet
gone away from their land.

  [113] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

  [114] Payaguás. These were the Indians who killed Juan de Ayolas
  and all his people, according to Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca in his
  _Comentarios_, _infra_, and Ruy Diaz de Guzman in _La Argentina_; also
  Herrera, _Década_, v, libro 7, capitulo 5.

Our commander then obtained permission from the judge and the
provost-marshal that the two prisoners should be put to the torture
in order that they might tell the truth; and by his order they were
tormented in such a manner that they were compelled to confess that they
had killed the Christians and their chief.

In consequence thereof our commander Martin Domingo Eijolla had them
judged, and ordered the two Peijembas to be tied to a tree around which
a great fire was made in order to burn them.

Meanwhile it seemed good to us Christians to elect Martin Domingo
Eijolla for our chief commander (especially because he had behaved so
well against the war-people), until H. I. Majesty should give further
orders.

Then Martin Eijolla ordered to prepare four parchkadienes,[115] and
taking one hundred and fifty soldiers, the others being left in the
aforesaid town of Noster Signora, he gave us to understand that he would
gather together the other people who had been left among the Peijembas
for reasons before mentioned,[116] and the one hundred and sixty
Spaniards left at Bonas Aeieres[117] in the two ships, and bring them
to the town Noster Signora Desumsion. Then he, Martin Domingo Eijolla,
departed with these four brigantines down the rivers Parabol and
Paranon.[118]

  [115] Brigantines.

  [116] On account of sickness, _cf. ante_, p. 26.

  [117] Buenos Ayres.

  [118] Paraguai and Parana.

Now before we came to the Thijembas,[119] it was resolved by the
Christians who waited there for us, namely, by a captain named
Franciscus Ruis, and Johann Paban, a priest, and a secretary named
Johann Ernandus,[120] governors of the Christians, that they would kill
the chief of the Thijembus, and certain other Indians, and they verily
performed this impious and mischievous deed, and put from life to death
the Indians who had rendered them for so long a time so many services
before we came down there with Martin Domingo Eijolla.

  [119] Timbus.

  [120] These names are Francisco Ruiz Galan, Juan Pavon and Juan
  Hernandez; Juan Pavon was not a clergyman, but an alcalde.

And when we arrived at these Thijembus and Christians, our commander
was alarmed at this murder and at the flight of the Thijembus.[119] But
he could do nothing, and therefore he left victuals in the castle of
Corpus Christi, also our twenty men, with a commander named Antonius
Manchossa,[121] and gave strict orders that he should not trust the
Indians in any way, but that he should keep strict watch by day and
by night, and if it happened that the Indians should come back and be
friendly with him, that he should deal courteously with them, and give
them all tokens of friendship, yet to be on his guard and beware lest
any misfortune should happen to them or to other Christians.

  [121] Antonio de Mendoza.

Now our commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla,[122] took down with him those
three persons who were the authors of the manslaughter, namely Francisco
Ruis, the priest Johann Paban, and Ernandus, the secretary. And when
they were about to take their journey and depart from us, a chief
of the Thijembus, named Zeicho Lijemii,[123] came; this one was the
Christians' friend, who showed good-will towards them, but from a false
and treacherous heart (as will be seen hereafter) said falsely that he
must pretend to be on good terms with the Indians, for the sake of wife,
children, and friends. And he engaged with our commander to take all the
Christians with him down the river, because the whole country was up
in arms against them to kill them or drive them out. To whom our chief
commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla answered, that he would soon be back,
that his people were strong enough to resist the Indians, and added,
that he, Zeiche Lijemii should come over to the Christians, with wife,
children, and friends, and with all his folk; and Zeiche Lijemii replied
that he would do so.

  [122] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

  [123] This is not a Guaraní name; it is undoubtedly an error on the
  part of the author.

Then our chief commander sailed down the river, leaving us at Corpus
Christi. About eight days afterwards, the aforesaid Indian Zeicho
Lijemii sent one of his brothers, named Suelapa,[124] treacherously, and
requested our commander, Antonius Manchossa, to place at his disposal
six Christians armed with guns and other weapons, for he wished to bring
his household with his family to us, and henceforth live among us, and
he remarked withal that he feared the Thijembus, and that without such
help, he could scarcely hope to bring his things out in safety. He
showed himself in such a way as though he would bring us victual and all
sorts of necessaries, but that was all knavery and deception.

  [124] Not a Guaraní name.

Our commander not only promised him six men, but gave him fifty well
armed Spaniards, and ordered these fifty men to be watchful and on their
guard, in order that they might not suffer any harm at the hands of the
Indians.

It was not more than half a mile distance from us Christians to
these Thijembus, and when our fifty men came to their settlement, the
Thijembus came out to them, and gave them a Judas kiss, and brought them
fish and meat to eat.

Now when the Christians began to fall to their meat, these Thijembus,
with their allies who were hidden in the houses and in the fields,
suddenly fell upon them, and so consecrated the banquet with them, that
not a man of them escaped alive, but one lad called Kalderon.[125] God
be merciful to them and to us all. Amen.

  [125] Calderon.

Afterwards they set upon us with ten thousand men or more, and besieged
us, and thought they would vanquish us, but that did not happen, God
be praised! although they stayed fourteen days before our place, and
attacked us day and night.

They had this time long spears or javelins, which they had learnt how
to make from the Christians, with which they drave at us and defended
themselves.

And it happened on that same day that the Indians attacked us by night
with all their force, and burnt down our houses, that our commander,
Antonius Manchossa,[126] armed with a two-handed sword ran out of a gate
near which some Indians lay in ambush so that they could not be seen;
and the Indians thrust him through with their spears, so that he
presently fell down dead without uttering a word. God's mercy be with
him! Now the Indians could not remain any longer because they had
nothing to eat, so they broke up half their camp and departed.

  [126] Antonio de Mendoza.

After this two brigantines laden with provisions and other necessaries
came to us from Bonas Aeieres[127] sent by our commander, Martin Domingo
Eijolla,[128] in order that we might maintain ourselves where we were
until the said commander's arrival, which cheered us very much indeed.
But those who came with the two ships were very sorrowful for the
Christians that were slain. We therefore determined by a common council,
and found it best to abide no longer in the village of Corpus Christi
near these Thijembus, but we went all of us down the river and came to
Bonas Aeieres to our commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla. He was much
shocked and very angry about the slaughter of the people, and doubtful
how to consult what he should first do, seeing that victual and other
necessary things failed us.

  [127] Buenos Ayres.

  [128] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

But after we had stayed for five days at Bonas Aeieres, a ship called a
_Carabelle_,[129] came from Spain, and brought us fresh tidings to wit,
that a ship had arrived at St. Catharina, whose captain was called
Albernunzo Gabrero,[130] and he had brought with him two hundred
soldiers from Spain.

  [129] Caravela.

  [130] Alonso Cabrera.

As soon as our commander had heard these tidings, he ordered one of the
two lesser ships, which was called a galleon, to be made ready; and sent
it along with the first to Sta. Catharina in Priesiell,[131] which is
thirty miles[132] from Bonas Aeieres, and appointed for it a commander
named Conssaillo Manchossa,[133] to govern the ship, and he charged him,
when he arrived with his ship at St. Catherina in Priesiell, to load
her with provisions, namely rice, manioc, and other things as he should
think fit.

  [131] Brazil.

  [132] From Buenos Ayres to the Island of Santa Catalina there are
  600 miles. Santa Catalina did not then belong to Brazil, but to the
  Gobernacion del Rio de la Plata (Government of the River Plate),
  belonging to the Spanish Crown. Schmidt could not have been ignorant
  of this, since he had been there with the expedition of Don Pedro de
  Mendoza.

  [133] Gonzalo Mendoza.

This commander, Conssaillo Manchossa, asked Martin Domingo Eijolla for
six trusty soldiers, whom he could rely upon; and they were promised
him. So he took me and six Spaniards, and also twenty more soldiers and
seamen.

Departing from Bonas Aeieres, we came in a month's time to St.
Catharina, and finding the above-mentioned ship which had arrived from
Spain, and the commander, Albernunzo Gabrero, with all his men, we were
greatly rejoiced, and stayed there for two months, loading our ship
with rice, manioc, and Turkish corn, so full that we could not take any
more.

Then having sailed with both ships and the commander, Albernunzo
Gabrero, and all his people from S. Catharina towards Bonas Aeieres in
India, we arrived at twenty miles from the river Paranaw Wassu.[134]
This river is forty miles wide at its mouth, and has the same width for
eighty miles, until one reaches a harbour called S. Gabriel, where the
river (Parana) has a width of eight miles.

  [134] In early times this river was called Rio de Solis, and
  afterwards also Paraná Guazú. Its mouth, as we have before stated
  (_supra_, p. 6), is 188 miles wide between Capes Santa Maria and San
  Antonio. The width of the Paraná proper, where it empties into the
  Plate, at the end of the Delta, is twenty-five miles, between the
  island of Martin Garcia and Point San Fernando.

Having arrived as before said, to within twenty miles of this river, on
All Saints' eve, the two ships approached at night close to one another,
and the one spoke the other, asking if we were in the river Paranaw; our
seaman said we were in that river, but the other one said we were at a
distance of twenty miles from it.

For when two, three, or more ships sail in company, they always come
together at sunset, and ask one another how long they have sailed day
and night, and what wind they intend taking at night, in order that they
may not separate from one another.

After this our skipper again addressed the master of the other ship,
asking if he would follow him, but the other said that it was already
night, and he would therefore stand out to sea till next morning, and
would not make the land by night; this skipper was indeed somewhat wiser
than ours as the event afterwards proved.

While our ship continued on its way that night, having parted company
with the other, great storm-winds arose at sea, so that we saw the land
by twelve or one o'clock, before we could anchor.

And when the ship had touched the ground, we having notwithstanding a
full mile to make in order to reach land, knew of no other counsel save
to appeal to God Almighty that He might be merciful and take pity on
us. That same hour our ship was broken into many thousand pieces, and
fifteen of our men and six Indians were drowned. Some taking hold of
large pieces of timber swam out, and I with five of my companions
escaped on the mast. But of the fifteen drowned we could not find one.
God bless them and us all. Amen.

We had afterwards to go on foot one hundred miles,[135] having lost all
our clothes and victual, and had to sustain ourselves with such roots
and fruits as we could find in the fields, until we came to the haven
called S. Gabriel, where we found the aforesaid ship with her captain,
which had arrived there thirty days before us.

  [135] The distance which Schmidt and his companions would have had
  to walk, in a straight line between Cape Santa Maria, where it is
  probable that the shipwreck took place, and the island of San Gabriel,
  would have been 255 English miles.

When this mishap had been reported to our commander, Martino Domingo
Eijolla,[136] he and all his men were very sorry, for they thought we
had all perished, and they had already caused masses to be said for our
souls.

  [136] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

As soon as we had arrived at Bonas Aeieres,[137] our commander, Martin
Domingo Eijolla, ordered the captain of our ship and the pilot to come
before him; and if there had not been much intercession on behalf of the
pilot he would have been hanged. He was, however, condemned to stay for
four years on the bergentin ships.

  [137] Buenos Ayres.

All the people being together at Bonas Aeieres, our chief captain
ordered that the bergentin ships should be made ready, and that all the
soldiers should be in them together, and that they should burn the great
ships; preserving, however, the iron tackling. After this had been done,
we sailed once more up the river Paranaw, and came to the town Noster
Signora Desumsion, where we remained two years, waiting further orders
from H. I. Majesty.

Meanwhile, another chief commander named Albernunzo Cabessa de
Bacha,[138] came from Spain, appointed by H. I. Majesty, with four
hundred men and thirty horses, in four vessels, two of which were large
ships, and the other two Karabella.[139] These four ships arrived in
Brazil at the haven called Wiessay, or S. Catherina,[140] to seek
provision of victual, and when the commander had sent the two Karabella
to sail eight miles distance from that port to seek for victuals, such
a storm befell them that they were both compelled to remain at sea, and
they perished, being broken all to pieces, but the men escaped.[141]
When the chief captain heard of this, he durst not put to sea with the
other two ships; but, since they were unseaworthy, he had them broken
up, and came to us in haste by land to Riodellaplata, to the town Noster
Signora desumsion, on the river Paraboe, and brought not more than three
hundred out of the four hundred men with him, the remainder having died
of hunger and disease.[142]

  [138] Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca.

  [139] Caravels.

  [140] Mbiaçá or Santa Catalina. Mbiaçá was the name of the country
  opposite the island, and at Schmidt's time it was not Brazil, but
  a part of the Government of the River Plate. That is why Barcia's
  Spanish translation says that Alvar Nunez arrived in Brazil _and_
  Santa Catalina, which is perfectly correct.

  [141] Cabeza de Vaca does not say that the two ships were wrecked, but
  that they had to put back to S. Catherina on account of bad weather.
  Cf. his _Comentarios_, _infra_.

  [142] When the Emperor was made acquainted of Don Pedro de Mendoza's
  death, he appointed another Adelantado to take his place, in case the
  Lieutenant-Governor whom Mendoza had left there had died too. The new
  Adelantado was Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, famous for his shipwrecks
  and adventures in Florida. Alvar Nunez sailed from Spain in November
  1540. He brought with him orders to take possession of the sea-coast
  belonging to Spain, south of the Portuguese Capitania de San Vicente.
  He first took possession of the ports of Cananea, San Francisco, and
  Santa Catalina, all pertaining to Spain. This island was given to
  the Adelantado as a personal gift for the term of twelve years, on
  condition of maintaining its possession and keeping there the Indians
  who inhabited it. Alvar Nunez stopped there several months. In May
  1541 he sent out some of his people to Buenos Ayres in one of his
  ships; but storms forced them to return to the island. The wrecks
  mentioned by Schmidt did not occur. Towards the end of the same year,
  Alvar Nunez with half his people and twenty-six horses started by
  land for Asuncion, and he gave the name of Province of Vera to the
  territory of Guaira (now the Brazilian Province of Paraná), which
  belonged to his Gobernacion. He marched across the province, taking
  possession of it on behalf of Spain, and arrived at Asuncion on the
  11th of March 1542, after a painful journey of four months and a half.
  The other half of Alvar Nunez's people, under the command of his
  nephew, Pedro Estopinan, went by sea to Buenos Ayres, and found the
  town of Don Pedro de Mendoza abandoned and the houses burnt by order
  of the ambitious Irala.

This Commander was eight whole months on his way, for the distance is
reckoned to be five hundred miles from Noster Signora desumsion to this
place or harbour of S. Catherina.

He also brought with him from Spain his commission from H. I. Majesty,
and required that Martin Domingo Eijolla[143] should yield up the whole
government to him, and that all the men should be obedient to him in
every respect. The commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla, and all the people
declared they were ready to obey, but with this understanding, that he,
Cabessa de Bacha, should show and lay before them some document to
prove that he had received from His Imperial Majesty such powers and
authority.

  [143] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

But this the whole assembly could not obtain from him; only the priests
and two or three of the captains affirmed it, that Albernunzo Cabessa de
Bacha ruled and commanded; but we shall see hereafter how things went
with him.

Now, this said Albernunzo Cabessa passed all the people in review,
and found that there were eight hundred men. At the same time he made
friendship with Martino Domingo Eijolla, and they became sworn brothers,
so that he, Martino Domingo Eijolla, no less than before commanded the
people.

After this review he, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, ordered nine
Bergentines to be prepared, that he might sail up the river Paraboe
as far as he could. But at the same time, and before the ships were
made ready, he sent out three Bergentines with one hundred and fifteen
soldiers, to go as far as they could, in order to find Indians who had
manioc and Turkish corn. He appointed them two captains, named Anthonius
Gabrero and Diego Tabellino. They came first to a people called
Surukufers,[144] who had Turkish corn, manioc, and other roots, such
as mandues, which resemble hazel-nuts, and also fish and meat.

  [144] Samacosis, says the Spanish translator, in Barcia's Collection.
  But the Indians in those parts were the Itatis and Guaycurús,
  generally known as the Cheriguanos. (Cf. _infra_, p. 40.)

The men wear in their lips a great blue stone, like a draughtsman, and
the women have their privities covered.

Among these people we left our ships, and with them some of our
companions to guard them, and went thence into the country. After four
days' journey we came to a village, occupied by the Carios, who were
about three thousand men strong, of whom we inquired diligently of the
state of that country, and we received honest and peaceable answers from
them. Returning thence, we again came back to our ships, and going down
the river of Paraboe, we came to a nation called the Achkeres. Here we
found a letter from our chief captain, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha,
to the effect that we should hang the chief of these Indians, named
Achkere.[145] Our commander at once complied with this order, out of
which afterwards a great war broke out, as will be seen hereafter.

  [145] Aracaré, according to Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, in the
  _Comentarios_, by Pero Hernandez, secretary to the Adelantado,
  Valladolid, 1555. (See _infra_.)

Now, when this had happened, to wit, that the above-mentioned Indian
had come by his death in this way, we returned down the river to Noster
Signora desumsion, and told our commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha,
what we had done and seen during this voyage. Then he asked the chief
Indian who was in the town Noster Signora,[146] that he should appoint
him two thousand Indians who should go with us up the river.

  [146] La Asuncion.

The Indians promised to be willing and obedient, and added that our
commander should first of all think well about it before going into that
country,[147] because the whole of it belonged to Dabere,[148] a chief
of the Carios, who was prepared to come out in full force against the
Christians. For this Dabere, they said, was Achkere's brother, whom the
Christians hanged, and therefore he intended to avenge his brother's
death. So our commander had to refrain from this voyage, and prepare
himself to go to war against his enemies. He then ordered his sworn
brother, Martino Domingo Eijolla,[149] to take four hundred Christians
and two thousand Indians, and go against this Dabere and the Carios, and
either drive them out of the whole country or utterly destroy them.
The said Eijolla faithfully followed this mandate, and went with these
people out of the city Noster Signora, and advanced towards the enemy,
having first warned them on behalf of H. I. Majesty.

  [147] In orig.: "auss dem Landt"; in the Latin version: "in illam
  regionem", and this appears the better reading.

  [148] Tabaré.

  [149] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

But this Dabere, little regarding the warning, would admit no treaty of
peace; for he had gathered a considerable number of people together, and
his settlements were very strongly fenced with palisadoes, which means
wooden walls[150]; and compassed about with three such walls and many
wide pits whereof we have already spoken; but we had found all this out
before. So we stood still quietly with our army till the fourth day
before we proclaimed war against them; the fourth day in the morning,
three hours before daybreak, we fell upon the place, slaying all that we
found there, and we captured many women, preserving them from slaughter,
which was a great help to us afterwards.

  [150] _I.e._, stockades.

In this assault sixteen Christians were slain, and many of us wounded
and hurt. Also many of our Indians perished; but they did not gain very
much from us, for on their side more than three thousand were slain.

Not very long after Dabere came with his people to ask for mercy, and
that we should give him back his wives and children; then he and his
people would serve the Christians and obey them. Our commander was
compelled by H. I. Majesty to grant them that.

After this peace had been concluded, we again went down the river
Paraboe[151] to our chief commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha,[152]
and we told him how all had happened.

  [151] Paraguai.

  [152] Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca.

Then he thought of making his intended voyage, and he asked of Dabere,
who was now satisfied, two thousand armed Indians to go with him; and
they were willing, and promised to be always obedient. He also commanded
the Carios to load the nine little Bergentin ships.[153] All this being
done, he took five hundred Christians out of the eight hundred, and he
left the remaining three hundred in the town Noster Signora desumsion,
and appointed as their commander Johann Salleisser.[154]

  [153] Brigantines.

  [154] Juan Salazar.

He then sailed up the river Paraboe with this army of five hundred
Christians and two thousand Indians.

The Carios had eighty-three canoes, and we Christians had nine Bergentin
ships, in every one of which there were two horses; but the horses
were conveyed overland one hundred miles, and we went by water unto a
mountain called S. Fernando,[155] where the horses were shipped, and
then we came to our enemies, the Peijembus,[156] but they did not wait
for us, but soon fled away with their wives and children, having first
burnt down their houses. After this we travelled together for one
hundred miles, and found no people all that way, till at length we came
to a nation named the Bachereos,[157] who live on fish and meat. It is a
numerous people, who inhabit a large country over one hundred miles in
extent, and they have also many canoes. Their women have their privities
covered. They would not speak with us, but fled away from us. Afterwards
we came to another people called Surukusis, where the three aforesaid
ships were.[158] They were at ninety miles distance from the Baschereos,
and they received us in a friendly way; each of them has his own
lodging, with his wife and children; the men have a rounded piece of
wood like draughts, hanging at the end of their ears. The women wear a
grey stone of crystal, thick and long as a finger, in their lips; they
are nice-looking, and go about quite naked. They have also plenty
of Turkish corn, manioc, manduis, padades, etc., fish and meat in
abundance; it is a great people.

  [156] Payaguás.

  [158] Cf. _ante_, p. 37.

Our commander asked them about a people named Carchkareos,[159] and also
about the Carios. They could not give information about the Carchkareos,
but they said that the Carios were with them in their houses; but it was
not true.

  [159] Charcas.

Having learned this, our commander ordered us to prepare ourselves in
order to go further into the country. He appointed one hundred and fifty
men to stay with the ships, to whom he gave provision for two years. And
he took the three hundred and fifty Christians and the eighteen horses,
and the two thousand Indians or Carios who went out with us from Noster
Signora desumsion, and marched into the country; but he did not do much,
because he was not the right sort of man. Besides, all the officers and
soldiers hated him for his perverse and rigorous carriage towards the
men. We travelled eighteen days' journey without seeing either Carios
or any other people; and food also failing us, our commander was again
obliged to return with us to the ships. And when we turned back he sent
out a Spaniard, named Franciscus Riefere,[160] with ten other armed
Spaniards, and ordered them to go forward ten days' journey, and if in
that time they should not find any other people, they should return to
us to the ships, where we would wait for them.

  [160] Francisco de Ribera.

It happened that they found a populous nation of Indians, who had plenty
of Turkish corn, manioc, and other roots. But the Spaniards durst not
show themselves, but returned to us, and told it to our chief captain.
He was very desirous to have gone into that country, but was hindered by
waters[161] that he could not proceed. He therefore ordered a ship to be
furnished, wherein he put eighty men, and gave us Ernando Rieffere[162]
for our captain, and sent us up the river Paraboe to discover the nation
named Scherues,[163] and ordered that we should go two days' journey
into the interior of the country and no farther, and then report to him
of that land and its inhabitants.

  [161] Floods.

  [162] Hernando de Ribera.

  [163] Xarayes; cf. Hernando de Ribera's narrative, _infra_.

So departing, on the first day we came on the other side of the country
to a people named Surukusis, who live in an island[164] which is thirty
miles wide, and encompassed by the river Paraboe; they eat manioc,
maize, manduis, padades, mandepore, parpii, Bachkeku, and other roots;
also fish and meat. The men and women are like the above-mentioned
Surukusis in face and figure. We remained one day among them, and the
second day we set off again. Ten canoes of these Indians accompanied
us and showed us our way, and twice a day they hunted wild beasts and
fished to supply us with food. After six days' journey we came to a
people called Achkeres. They are very numerous, men and women, are
big and tall, the like whereof were not to be seen in the whole
Riodellaplata. These Achkeres are three miles distance from the
aforesaid Surukusis; they have nothing to eat but fish and meat; the
women have their privities covered. Among these Achkeres[165] we
remained one day, and then the above-mentioned Surukusis returned with
their ten canoes to their village. Afterwards our commander, Ernando
Riefere[166] asked the Achkeres to show us the way to the Scherues, and
they were willing to do so, and came with eight canoes out of their
place with us, and twice every day fished and hunted, so that we should
have plenty to eat. The reason why they are called Achkeres, is as
follows.

  [164] This island was called Isla del Paraiso (Paradise Island) by the
  Spaniards. The Indians living there were the Itatis.

  [165] _Yacaré_ is the name, in the Guaraní language, of the amphibious
  animals similar to the crocodile, to which Schmidt alludes hereafter.
  But there never was a tribe of that name; perhaps it was the name of a
  cacique.

  [166] Hernando de Ribera.

Achkarus is a fish which has a hard skin all over, so that it cannot be
wounded with a knife, nor can one shoot it with an Indian dart. It is a
big fish, which does great harm to other fishes. Its eggs, which it lays
at about two or three paces from the water's edge, have the taste of
musk and are good for eating; the tail is the best part, though the
whole fish is harmless; it lives always in the water. In our Germany
that fish is reckoned to be noxious and even venomous, and is called
a crocodile. And it is said, that if one looks at that fish, and even
more, if the fish breathes upon any one, that person must by all means
die; which is not according to truth, for man must also die without
that, and nothing is more certain.

Further it is said that if such a fish is found in a well, there is no
other means to kill it than to show it a mirror, in order that it may
look at itself therein; it must then die from the sight of its own
atrocious face.

But all these sayings are fables, and nothing else, for I should have
died a hundred times if it had been true, having caught and eaten over
three thousand of these fishes myself, and I would not have written so
much about this fish if I had not had such good reason for it.

The ninth day after our departure we came to the Scherues,[167] who are
reckoned to be thirty-six miles distant from the Achkeres. This nation
is very populous, but these were not the genuine people among whom the
king lives. These Scherues to whom we now came wear a moustache, and
have a wooden ring in the tips of their ears, and the ear is folded
round the wooden ring in a wonderful manner. The men have also a large
blue crystal in their lips of the shape and size of a draughtsman. And
they are painted blue on their bodies from the head to the knees so as
to give them the appearance of wearing breeches.

  [167] Xarayos. These and the Itatis were the Indians living near the
  island of Paraiso, on the left bank of the river Paraguai. According
  to the best authorities the right name for this tribe is _Guarayos_.

But the women are painted otherwise, blue from the breast to the
privities, and so artistically, that one could not soon find a painter
to do it so well. They are absolutely naked, and are beautiful after
their manner, and also commit transgressions in the dark.

Among these Scherues we remained one day, and afterwards in three days'
journey we came to a king, who lives at fourteen miles distance, and
whose people are also called Scherues. His country is only four miles
wide, but he has also a settlement on the river Paraboe.

There we left our ship with twelve Spaniards to watch it, that we might
use it for our defence on our return. We also ordered these Scherues
dwelling there to hold friendly intercourse with the Christians, which
they also did.

We remained thus two days in this place, and prepared ourselves for
travel, and took all that was wanted and passed over the river
Paraboe,[168] and so came to the King who lives there himself.

  [168] Paraguai.

And when we were approaching near and were about one mile off, the King
of the Scherues came forth to meet us with twelve thousand men, or even
more, on a heath, yet in a friendly and peaceable manner. The path they
followed was eight feet broad, and was covered entirely with flowers
and herbs up to their place, and made so clean that not so much as any
little stone, stick, or straw appeared. The King was also accompanied by
his musicians, whose instruments resemble our hoboys. His Royal Majesty
had also ordered that deer and other wild beasts should be hunted on
both sides of the way; so that they caught about thirty deer and twenty
ostriches, and it was indeed an agreeable thing to see; and when we came
to their place, the King appointed a house to accommodate every two
Christians, and our captain with his servants were taken into the Royal
House, and I was not very far from the King's house. Then the King of
the Scherues[169] and his subjects resolved to treat us Christians well,
and to give us all our necessaries. And the King also held a Court in
his own way, like the greatest lord in the country.

  [169] Xarayos.

At dinner the musicians must play whenever it is his pleasure. Then the
men and the most beautiful women must dance before him, and such a dance
is to us Christians quite wonderful, so much so that looking upon them
one could think of nothing else. These people are like the Scherues, of
whom we spoke before.

Their wives make mantles from cotton very subtle, almost like satin, on
which they embroider several figures, as deer, ostriches, Indian sheep,
or what else they can. In these mantles they sleep when it is cold, or
they sit upon them, or use them at their pleasure. These women are very
fair and venerous, very amiable, and very hot too, as it seemed to me.

There we remained four days. Meanwhile, the King asked our commander
what were our wishes, and whither we intended to go; and our commander
replied he was seeking for gold and silver. The King gave him a silver
crown, which weighed one and a half mark nearly, and a bar of gold,
a span and a half in length and half a span broad; also a bracelet,
_i.e._, a half-harness, and many other things in silver, and then said
to our commander: He had no more gold or silver, and that these things
were the spoils which in time past he had won in war from the Amazons.

And when he came to speak of the Amazons, and gave us to understand of
their great riches, we were very glad to learn of it. And our commander
presently asked the King if we could come to them by water; and how far
it was to these Amazons.

The King answered we could not reach them by water, but would have to go
by land, and travel during two whole months. Thereupon we decided to go
to these Amazons, as will be related hereafter.

These women, the Amazons, have only one breast, and the men come to
their wives only three or four times in the year; and if the woman,
being in child by her husband, bring forth a male child, she sends that
boy away to his father.

But if it be a girl, she keepeth it with her, and seareth the right
breast, in order that it may grow no more. The reason for this is, that
they may be more fit to handle their weapons and bows, for they are
war-like women, making continual war against their enemies.

These women inhabit an island surrounded by water, and a large island it
is too; and there is no access to it but by canoes. But in this island
the Amazons have neither gold nor silver, though they are reported to
have great riches in the _terra firma_ where the men live. It is a very
great nation, and is said to have a King whose name appears to be
Iegnis, and they told us where he lived.

Now, our commander, Ernando Rieffere,[170] desired the said King of the
Scherues[171] to place at our disposal some of his subjects to carry
our plunder and to show us the way, because he intended to enter the
interior of the country, and to seek out those above-mentioned Amazons.
The King was willing to do so, but he said that at this time of the year
the land would be under water, and therefore travelling there would not
do at this season. We would not, however, believe his words, but were
urgent to have his Indians. He therefore gave our commander for his
person twenty men to carry his plunder and victual, and to each of us he
gave five Indians to serve us and carry our necessaries, for we would
have to go eight days' journey without finding an Indian.

  [170] Hernando de Ribera.

  [171] Xarayos. All that precedes about the Amazons is a ridiculous
  tale which Schmidt could not have heard from any of those poor
  Indians, who had not the slightest idea about the Scythian mythology
  or the ancient fables from which this passage of his book is taken,
  after the fashion for the wonderful, prevalent at this period. The
  source of this story in the New World is the voyage made in 1540-41 by
  the Spanish officer, Orellana, who was the first to navigate the great
  river called _of the Amazons_, on account of his having related that
  he met on its banks a tribe of women warriors.

Afterwards we came to a certain nation called Siberis, who resemble the
Scherues in their language and in other respects. We advanced for eight
whole days and nights in water up to the knees, and sometimes as high
as the waist; nor could we by any means come out of it. When we wished
to make a fire, we heaped big fagot-sticks one on another, and made a
fire thereon; and it happened several times that as we were about to
cook our meat, both the pot in which we had our food and the fire fell
into the water, and then we had to remain without eating. We also could
not find any rest either by day or night, because of the small flies,
against which we could do nothing.

We therefore asked these Siberis if there were any more water, and they
said we would have to wade four more days in the water, and afterwards
would have to travel five other days by land; and at length we should
come to a people named Orthuses,[172] and they gave us to understand
that we were too few in number, and therefore we had better return. But
this we would not do for the Scherues sake, for we thought rather of
sending them back to their town who were accompanying us. But the said
Scherues refused to go, because the King had ordered them not to leave
us, but to serve us until we came again out of that country.

  [172] Urtuesses; cf. Hernando de Ribera's narrative, _infra_.

The aforesaid Siberis then gave us ten men, who, together with the
Scherues, should show us the way to the aforesaid Orthuses; so we went
along for another seven days through water up to the waist or the knee;
this water was quite as hot as if it had been heated on the fire, and
we were compelled to drink it, for want of any other water. Some might
suppose that it was a flowing water, but this was not so, for at that
time rain had fallen so heavily that the whole land was inundated, for
it is a flat land; how we suffered from the effects of this water shall
be told hereafter.

Thus on the ninth day, between ten and eleven before noon, we came to
the place of the Orthuses, and by midday we arrived in the centre of the
village, where the chief's house stands.

But at that very time there was a great mortality among the Orthuses,
caused by famine, for they had nothing to eat, the locusts or
grasshoppers having twice eaten and destroyed all the corn and the
fruits of their trees. When we Christians saw this, and heard how things
were going there, we became frightened, and could not remain long in the
land, because we also had not much to eat. So our commander asked their
chief how many days' journey we yet had to the Amazons, and he said we
must yet travel one full month to reach them, and besides, all the land
was full of water, as it indeed appeared.

Now the chief of the Orthuses presented our commander with four
Pleynisch[173] of gold, and four silver rings which they wear on the
arm; but the Indians wear the plates on their foreheads for ornaments,
as our nobles do their gold chains on their necks. For all this, our
commander gave the chief of the Indians a hatchet, knives, paternosters,
scissors, and other things which are made at Nuremberg. We would have
wished more from them, but we durst not ask it, for we Christians were
not numerous enough, and therefore had to beware of them. The Indians,
on the contrary, were very numerous, and their town so large, that I had
hitherto never seen in the whole of India so many people together, nor
such a big place, although I have been far and wide. The mortality
among the Indians, dying from hunger, certainly was our good luck, for
otherwise we Christians might not perhaps have escaped with our lives.

  [173] Plates.

When we again returned to the aforesaid Siberis, we were ill-provided
with victual, for they had nothing to eat but a tree called a palm, and
cardes,[174] and other roots which grow underground. And when we came
to the Scherues, our people were half dead for sickness, because of the
water and the poverty that we had to undergo during this journey, for
we never came out of the water for thirty days and nights together, and
we were always constrained to drink of that impure water.

  [174] Thistles.

So we remained among the Scherues, where the King lives, for four days,
and they treated us very well, and waited on us diligently, and the King
ordered his subjects to give us all things necessary.

On this journey each of us plundered nearly two hundred ducats' worth
of Indian cotton mantles and silver, having secretly bartered these for
knives, paternosters,[175] scissors, and looking-glasses.

  [175] Rosaries.

After all this we again went down the river to our chief commander,
Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha,[176] and when we arrived, he ordered us on
our lives not to come out of the ships, and he came also in person to
us and ordered our commander, Ernando Rieffere,[177] to be cast into
prison, and took from us soldiers all that we had brought with us from
the country; and finally, he would have hanged our commander, Ernando
Rieffere, on a tree. But when we heard of this, we being still in the
Bergentin,[178] raised a great tumult along with other good friends who
were on shore, against our chief commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha,
demanding that he should set our commander, Ernando Rieffere, free, and
restore to us all of that which he had taken away, otherwise we should
take measures accordingly. Seeing such an uproar and our wrathful
indignation, he was very glad indeed to let our commander go free, and
to restore to us all he had taken away, giving us fair words that we
might be pacified; how it fared with him afterwards shall presently be
told.

  [176] Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca.

  [177] Hernando de Ribera.

  [178] Brigantine.

All this having occurred, and peace being established, he desired our
commander, Ernando Rieffere, and us to give him a report on the country
we had been to; and explain how it happened that we had remained so
long absent; and we gave him an answer wherewith he was well satisfied.
That he had received us so badly and taken our things away, was the
result of our not having obeyed his mandate; for he had only ordered us
to go as far as the Scherues,[179] and four days' journey inland, and
then to return and report to him; we on the contrary had gone for
eighteen days beyond the country of the Scherues.

  [179] Xarayos.

Now our chief commander, after the report we had made of it, would have
marched with all his people to that country to which we had just been;
but we soldiers would not agree thereto, especially at this very time
when the country was quite under water.

Moreover, most of the people were very feeble and ill, besides which our
chief commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, commanded no great respect
or favour among the soldiers, for he was a man who had never held a
command nor any important post whatsoever.

So we remained for two months among the aforesaid Siberis (Surukusis?),
during which time our chief commander got a fever, which made him very
ill--it would have been no great loss had he died at this time, for he
really commanded no great respect among us.

In this country of the Surukusis I did not find a single Indian who was
forty or fifty years of age, nor have I ever in my life experienced a
more unhealthy country; for it lies under the tropic, _i.e._, there
where the sun is at the highest; it is as unhealthy as Sancte
Thome.[180]

  [180] The island of San Thomé, off the west coast of Africa.

Being among the Surukusis, I saw the constellation of Ursa Major, of
which we had lost sight when we passed the island of S. Augo.[181]

  [181] St. Iago, one of the Cape Verd islands, cf. _supra_, p. 4.
  Hulsius observes that in the tropic of Capricorn, in which Surukusis
  is situated, the elevation of the pole is 221°, and the constellation
  of Ursa Major would be visible here at its highest elevation in the
  sky for several hours. The author's remark that he lost sight of this
  constellation at the island of St. Iago is, according to the same
  commentator, wholly erroneous. This island is in N. lat. 15°;
  the declination of the star ? Ursa Majoris, the northernmost of
  the group, is 62° 20' 2”. It would therefore appear on the horizon
  in S. lat. 27° 40', or 2,560 miles south of St. Iago.

Now our commander-in-chief ordered, in spite of his illness, one hundred
and fifty Christians and two thousand Indian Carios to go with four
Bergentin ships,[182] four miles distance to the island of the
Surukusis, and commanded them to slay all these Surukusis or to take
them prisoners, and that they should principally destroy all persons
from forty to fifty years of age. The way these Surukusis had previously
entertained us has already been declared,[183] and how we rewarded and
thanked them will now appear. God knows that we did them wrong.

  [182] Brigantines.

  [183] Cf. _supra_, p. 42.

When, therefore, we arrived at their town unawares, they came out of
their houses with bows and arrows to meet us peaceably. But a tumult
arising between the Carios and the Surukusis, we Christians fired at
them and killed very many, and having made more than two thousand
prisoners, men, women, boys, and girls, we afterwards burnt down their
town, and took all they possessed that could be carried away, as in such
violent assaults is usual; then we turned back again to our commander,
Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, who was very well pleased with our deeds.

But our people being for the most part feeble and ill-affected towards
our chief commander, the latter could not do anything with them, so
he ordered a ship to be prepared, and we all went down the river
Paraboe,[184] and came to Noster Signora desumsion,[185] where we had
left the other Christians. There our chief commander fell sick again of
a fever, and kept indoors fourteen days together. It was, however, more
out of pride than out of weakness, for he did not please the people;
but showed himself unseemly towards them more than it behoved a lord or
commander who would govern a country; for such a man should always give
good counsel to everyone alike whatever their rank or station, and
always be good-hearted to all. Also it seems well that such an one
should so behave himself as he would like to appear to others, and
should be wiser and cleverer than those whom he commands. For it is very
bad and shameful that anyone should try to advance more in honours
than in wisdom. And nobody should boast himself of his high position,
despising others, like the vain and arrogant Thrasus[186] in Terentius,
who thinks that every commander is appointed for the sake of the men,
and not the soldiers nominated for the commander's sake.

  translation of this comedy, with a commentary by Hans Nythart, was
  printed at Ulm in 1486.

But here there has been no regard as to persons, but our commander has
in all things only followed his arrogant and vain inspiration.

Thereupon it was resolved by all, noble man and commoner, to meet in
council, with a view to take prisoner this chief commander, Albernunzo
Cabessa de Bacha, and to send him to H. I. Majesty, and to report to His
Majesty about his nice virtue, and how he had behaved towards us, and
how, according to his reason, he had governed; and other things besides.

According to the resolution come to, these three gentlemen, namely,
the treasurer or judge, the clerk or master of the toll or custom, and
the secretary ordained by H. I. Majesty, whose names were Albernunzo
Gabrero, Don Francisco Manchossa, Garze Hannego, Philippo de
Gastra,[187] etc., taking with them two hundred soldiers, went to his
lodging, and arrested our commander-in-chief, Albernunzo Cabessa de
Bacha, when he least expected it. And this happened on St. Mark's Day,
Anno 1543.[188] They held prisoner the said Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha
for a whole year, until a ship called a Carrabella,[189] provided with
victual and a crew, had been prepared. And on board this ship the
often-mentioned Cabessa de Bacha, with two other officers on behalf of
H. I. Majesty, were conveyed to Spain.

  Caceres.

  [188] This conspiracy against Alvar Nunez was the work of Domingo
  Martinez de Irala to get possession of the Government, in which he
  succeeded. Schmidt avows himself an accomplice, and this explains his
  unjust charges against the Adelantado, Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, who
  was the most honest and capable governor that this unfortunate colony
  had in early times. The imprisonment took place on the 25th of April
  1544, and lasted one year, during which Alvar Nunez suffered the most
  horrible treatment from his wicked enemies.

  [189] Caravel.

After that we had to elect another who should rule and govern the
country until H. I. Majesty had time to designate one himself. And we
held it for good, as it was the meaning and the will of the community,
to nominate as chief Domingo Eijollas,[190] not only because he had
formerly governed the country, but especially because most of the
soldiers were satisfied with him.

  [190] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

However, there were some who had been the special friends of our
aforesaid chief commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, who were not
pleased. But we did not care for that.

About this time I was very weak and ill with dropsy, which I, along with
my fellow-comrades, had caught in our journey to the Orthuses, when
we waded so long in the water, besides suffering want and intolerable
hunger, as I have related; for nearly eighty of our people fell ill, and
not more than thirty men escaped death.

And when Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha was sent to Spain there was discord
among us Christians, and soon we fought day and night, so that any one
would have thought that the devil governed among us; and no man was safe
from the other.

We thus made war among ourselves for two whole years, the sending away
Cabessa de Bacha being the occasion of it. And when the Carios, who had
formerly been our friends, perceived that we Christians were disunited,
and had such false and treacherous hearts one towards another, they were
not at all pleased, for they thought that every realm that is divided
in itself and cannot agree must be destroyed. They therefore held a
council, and agreed that they would kill us and drive us out of their
country. But God Almighty--praise to Him, always and everlastingly--did
not grant these Carios that their designs should prosper; although the
whole country of the Carios and other nations, such as the Aygais,[191]
were against us Christians.

  [191] Agazes.

But when we perceived this state of things we were obliged to make
peace among ourselves. And we also entered into a treaty with two other
tribes, one named the Jeperis, and the other the Bachacheis,[192] who
numbered five thousand men in all. They eat only fish and flesh, are
courageous in battle on land and water, but prefer fighting on land.
Their weapons are tardes,[193] half a spear in length but not so thick,
and the points are tipped with flint. They have also truncheons under
their girdles four spans long with a knob at the end.

  [192] Yapirús and Mbaiás.

  [193] Darts.

Every one of these Indians has also ten or twelve small sticks of wood,
or as many in fact as he chooses to carry, a good span long, and on
the point of every stick is fixed a broad and long fish's tooth (named
Palmede[194] in Spanish) that resembles a sea-tench. This tooth cuts
like a razor; but you should know what they do with these teeth, or what
use they put them to.

  [194] Palometa.

Firstly, they fight with the aforesaid tardes, and in case they are
victorious over their enemies, and that these take to flight, they
abandon their tardes and run after the enemies and throw their
truncheons under their feet, in order to cause them to fall to the
ground; then, without looking to see if they are yet half-alive or dead,
they cut their heads off with the aforesaid fish-tooth. This is done so
quickly that one has scarcely time enough to turn round; afterwards they
put this tooth back again under their girdle or their other clothing.

Mark you, now, what he does further with the man's head, and to what use
he puts it, namely, if he has any opportunity for so doing, after such a
skirmish. He takes off the skin with all the hair over the ears, then he
fills the head out and leaves it to become hard; afterwards he puts this
hard and dry skin on a little hoop as a souvenir, in the same way as
here in Germany a knight or commander puts a scutcheon in the churches.

But to return to our narrative, and to make it short. It so happened
that the Jeperis and Bachacheis[195] came to us with about one thousand
men, which pleased us very much; we then went out of the town Noster
Signora Desumsion with our chief commander, besides three hundred and
fifty Christians and these one thousand Indians, so that every Christian
had three men to look after him, whom our commander had ordered for
them. And we came afterwards to a distance of three miles from the
place where our enemies the Carios, who numbered fifteen thousand, were
encamped in the open, in good order. Now when we were only half a mile
from them we would do nothing that day for we were tired and it was
raining; so we remained in the wood, where we passed the night. The
following morning we marched against them at six o'clock, and coming
upon them by seven, we fought together till ten. Then they were obliged
to fly, and ran in haste to a place four miles distant, which they had
fortified, and its name was called Froemiliere.[196] The Indian chief
was Machkaria. In this skirmish the dead on the enemy's side who were
killed by us numbered two thousand, whose heads the Jeperis[197] carried
on their spears. And on our side there fell ten Christians besides the
wounded, whom we sent back to Noster Signora Desumsion; but we pursued
the enemy with all our army to their place Froemiliere, whither
Machkaria their chief had fled. But these Carios had fortified their
place with three wooden stockades, like a wall. The wooden posts were as
thick as a man in the middle part of his body, or even thicker, three
fathoms high, and sunk into the earth the height of a man.

  [195] Yapirús and Mbaiás.

  [196] It is impossible to interpret this name, which certainly is not
  Guaraní.

  [197] Yapirús.

They had also dug pits or deep holes, and planted in each of them five
or six pointed stakes as sharp as needles. So this town of theirs was
very strong, and contained many valiant warriors; there can be no doubt
about that. And we lay three days before that place without being able
to do anything or to win anything from them.

However, at length, by God's help, we became stronger than they were.

We soon made great _Bodelle_ or _Pabesse_[198] out of the skins of deer
and of the _amida_.[199] This is a big beast, like a good-sized mule; it
has feet like a cow, but on the whole resembles an ass; and its flesh
is suitable to be eaten. There are plenty of them in this country; and
their skin is half a finger thick. Such a pabesse we gave to every
Indian of the Jeperis, and to others a good hatchet, and between two
such Indians we placed an arquebuss shooter. There were over four
hundred of these targets.

  [198] Spanish words, _rodela_ or _pavés_, _i.e._, shields and targets.

  [199] Anta or tapir.

Then we again attacked the enemy's town from three sides between two and
three o'clock in the morning; and, in less than three hours, the three
stockades were destroyed and won; we then came with all our people
into the town and slew many men, women, and children. But most of them
escaped and fled to another place of theirs called Carieba, twenty miles
distant from this place Froemiliere. This town they also fortified, and
there was a great mass of these Carios there together. This town stood
very close to a big forest, in order that if we Christians again
conquered it, they might retain the forest as a protection, as will
be seen hereafter. Now, when we Christians, along with our Commander
Martino Domingo Eijolla,[200] together with the aforesaid Jeperis
and Bachacheis, had followed our enemies the Carios up to this place
Carieba, at about five o'clock in the evening, we established our army
on three sides of the place, on a concealed eminence in the forest.
There came also reinforcements to us from Noster Signora Desumsion,[201]
two hundred Christians and five hundred Jeperis and Bachacheis,[202]
because many of our people, Christians and Indians, had been wounded
before the aforesaid place, so that we were compelled to send them back
and to have these fresh soldiers instead of them. Now, therefore, we
numbered four hundred and fifty Christians and one thousand three
hundred Jeperis and Bachacheis. But our enemies the Carios had now
fortified their place more strongly than ever, namely with palissadoes
(stockades) and very many trenches.

  [201] Asuncion.

  [202] Yapirús and Mbaiás.

They had also prepared iron plates,[203] which were made like rat
traps, of which a single one, if it had gone according to their wish,
would have each time slain twenty or thirty men. There were plenty of
these traps in the place, but God Almighty willed otherwise, so praise
be to Him everlastingly. We lay, therefore, before this place, Carieba,
four days without being able to do them any harm; but at length, by
treachery (such as is to be found everywhere), there came an Indian
from our enemies, the Carios, at night to our commander, Martin Domingo
Eijolla.[204] That Indian was one of the chiefs of the Carios, and to
him belonged the town. This man bade us not to burn down his town, nor
to destroy it; and if we consented, he was willing to show us the manner
in which we could take the place. Our commander promised this to him,
and that no harm should be done him. Accordingly this Cario showed us
two paths in the forest by which we could penetrate into the place, and
said that he would light a fire in his town, and during that time we
should break into it. All this having been done, we Christians entered
the town and slew a great number of people. Those who took to flight ran
right into the hands of their enemies, the Jeperis, by whom the greater
part were killed. But this time they had not their wives and children
with them, having concealed them in a great wood four leagues distant
from that place.

  [203] This is a mistake of the author's; the Indians having no iron.

  [204] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

Those among the Carios who had escaped this conflict fled to another
Indian chief, named Thabere,[205] and the village which entertained them
is called Juberich Sabaije.[206] It is at one hundred and forty miles
distance from Carieba, and we could neither pursue them, nor make that
journey, because the whole way they had passed they had wasted far and
near with fire, in order that we might not find anything to eat; but
we remained fourteen days at Carieba, where we healed the wounded and
rested the while.

  [205] Tabaré.

  [206] Yeruquihaba.

Then we went again to our town, Noster Signora Desumsion, in order to be
enabled to sail up the river and seek out the aforesaid place, Juberich
Sabaije, where the Indian chief Thabere lived.

When we came to our town, Noster Signora Desumsion, we also remained
there fourteen days, in order to provide ourselves with all sorts
of victual and ammunition for the journey. Our commander now took
reinforcements with him--Christians and Indians--because many had been
wounded and many were ill.

We then went up the river Paraboe[207] to our enemies' town, Juberich
Sabaije, with nine Bergentin ships and two hundred canoes and one
thousand five hundred Indians. According to the Jeperis it was forty-six
miles distant from Noster Signora desumsion to Juberich Sabaije, whither
our enemies, the Carieba, had fled.

  [207] Paraguai.

On the way thither the chief of the Carios, the same who had betrayed
the town, met us; and he brought with him one thousand Carios to aid
us against the aforesaid Thabere.[208] Now, when our commander, Martin
Domingo Eijolla,[209] had assembled all these people together at two
miles distance from Juberich Sabaije, he sent two Carios Indians to
their enemies in the town to warn them that the Christians were there
again; and to tell them that they should return to their country,
each of them to his wife and children, and should be obedient to the
Christians and serve them again, as they had done before, and if they
refused we would drive them all out of the country.

  [208] Tabaré.

  [209] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

Thereupon the chief Cario, Thabere,[208] answered that they should tell
the Christian chiefs that he knew neither them nor the Christians, and
would put us Christians to death; indeed they severely beat our two
Indians and told them to disappear very quickly out of their camp else
they would kill them.

The two messengers came back to our commander, and brought him the
tidings how they had been treated. Thereupon Martin Domingo Eijolla was
at one accord with us, and we advanced against our enemy, Thabere,[210]
and the Carios, in order of battle, dividing our army into four parts.

  [210] Tabaré.

We came to a river called Sthuesia,[211] which is as wide as the river
Danube in our land, half the height of a man deep, and in some places
even deeper, and it becomes at times very great and causes much harm in
the country, and by reason of such inundation it is impossible to travel
through the country.

  [211] This may be the river Xejuy, or the Ipané, affluents of the
  river Paraguai.

As we had to cross this river, our enemies being on the other side with
their camp, they resisted us and did us a great deal of harm in the
crossing, so that I even believe that none of us had come out of it with
his life but for the grace of God which was beforehand on our side and
but for the guns that we had.

So God Almighty gave us His divine grace that we crossed the water by
His divine benediction, and landed on the other side. Now, when the
enemies saw that we had passed, they fled at once towards their town,
which was half a mile from the river, but we, seeing it, pursued them
with all our forces and came to the town as quickly as they themselves
and besieged it, so that none should enter or come out of it; we also
armed ourselves forthwith with our guns and pikes, and by the grace
of God Almighty we had only to stay from the morning till night to
overpower them, and become masters over them. We took the place, and
slaughtered much people.

However, before we attacked them, our commander ordered us not to kill
the women and children, but to take them prisoners; and we dutifully
obeyed his commands. But all the men we could get hold of had to die;
yet many escaped by flight, and our friends, the Jeperi,[212] took
nearly one thousand heads from our enemies, the Carios.

  [212] Yapirús. This word is sometimes rendered in the original
  "Jeperus".

After all this had happened, those Carios who had escaped came with
their chief, Thaberus,[213] and several other chiefs to our commander,
and entreated him for mercy that their wives and children might be
restored them, and then they would become friends again with us, and
serve us faithfully.

  [213] Tabaré.

Thereupon our commander promised them to be merciful, and took them into
favour, and ever afterwards they continued our good friends so long as I
remained in the country. This war with the Carios lasted for one year
and a half, _i.e._, that we never had peace with one another, and that
we were never sure of them; and this happened in the year 1546.

Afterwards we again went to Noster Signora desumsion,[214] and remained
there fully two years. But when during all this time no ships or
tidings arrived from Spain, our commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla,[215]
assembled all the people and asked them if it pleased them that he
should go with some people into the country to inquire if gold and
silver were to be found. The people answered him to do it in God's name.

  [214] The town of La Asuncion.

  [215] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

Accordingly he collected together three hundred and fifty Spaniards, and
asked them if they would accompany him, provided he found them in all
necessaries for the journey, such as Indians, horses, and clothing; they
declared their willingness to go. Then he had the chiefs of the Carios
assembled, and asked them if two thousand of their number would go with
him. They declared themselves ready to go and be obedient unto him.

With such friendly accord on both sides our commander, Martin Domingo
Eijolla, in a little more than two months went with this folk in the
year 1548 up the river Paraboe,[216] with seven Bergentin ships and two
hundred canoes. Those of the people who could not go in the ships or
canoes went on foot by land with the one hundred and thirty horses.[217]
And coming by land and by water all together to a round and high
mountain, called S. Fernando, where the aforesaid Peyembas[218] live,
our commander there ordered the five ships and the canoes to go back to
Noster Signora Desumsion. The other two Bergentin ships he left there
at S. Fernando, with fifty Spaniards, under the command of Peter
Diess[219]; he gave them also victuals and other necessaries for one
year, and ordered them to wait there till he returned from the country,
that the fate which befell the good gentleman Johann Eijollas[220]
and his companions, all of whom were so dreadfully killed by the
Peyembas,[221] might not also happen to him and his folk. God have
mercy upon them all. I have narrated this before.

  [216] Paraguai.

  [217] The expedition was composed of 250 Spaniards, and twenty-seven
  of them were cavalry.

  [221] Payaguás. The Sierra de San Fernando is a small ridge of
  mountains extending from 17° to 21° of south lat.

Then our commander went straight on with three hundred Christians, one
hundred and thirty horses, and three hundred Carios, for eight full days
without finding any people at all. On the ninth day we found a nation
called Naperus, who have nothing to eat but meat and fish; they are tall
and powerful; their wives have their nakedness covered, and are not at
all beautiful.

From the aforesaid mountain S. Fernando to this nation the distance is
thirty-six miles. Here we passed the night, and then went travelling
seven days more, when we came to a people called Maipai.[222] They are
a very numerous people, and have subjects who must plough the land and
fish for them, and generally do whatever they are ordered, just as at
home the peasants are subject to the noble lords. This nation is well
provided with Turkish corn, mandeochade, mandepore parpii, padades,
mandues,[223] bachkeku, and other roots useful for eating. They also
have deer, Indian sheep, ostriches, ducks, geese, poultry, and other
fowl.

  [222] Mepenes, who are Abipones.

  [223] These victuals are: maize, manioc, potatoes, sweet potatoes,
  pea-nuts, and perhaps bananas, which the author calls "bachkeku".

Their forests are full of honey out of which wine is prepared and other
things are made, and the farther you go into the country the more
fertile you will find it. They have all the year round Turkish corn in
the fields, and other roots as well. Their sheep, which are in a
wild state, they use as we do our horses, for riding and carrying
purposes.[224] I myself, having one foot ailing, once rode on such a
sheep for more than forty miles, though not in this journey. In Peru
goods are conveyed on these sheep as on horses at home.

  [224] These are the Peruvian llamas, and guanacos, from which the
  Indians took the wool, and wove rough cloth.

These Maijeaijs[225] are tall, erect, and warlike, giving all their
care to warlike affairs. Their wives are very beautiful and have their
nakedness covered. They do no work in the fields; the man has to look
after the food. Neither at home does the woman anything else but spin
wool, and prepare food, and also what pleases the man and other good
companions who pray her to do it, etc. We won't say anything more
about it; he who likes to see it, shall go thither, and if he does not
otherwise believe it, he will find it out for himself.

  [225] Mbaiás.

When we were not above half a mile distant from this people they met
us on the way, where there was a small clearing, where they told our
commander that we should remain for the night, and they would bring us
whatsoever we had need of, but they did this out of malice; and to win
more confidence, they presented our commander with four silver crowns to
wear on the head, and they gave him besides six silver plates, each of
which was one and a half span long and half a span wide.

These plates they bind on the forehead as ornaments, as we have told
before. They also presented our commander with three beautiful young
women. However, whilst we remained in that place, after supper we
stationed sentries, in order that the people might be on the alert for
the enemy, and afterwards we went to rest.

About midnight our commander lost his young wenches. In short, there was
great excitement in the camp for that reason, and as soon as the morning
dawned, our commander ordered that each of us should stand to his
quarters with his arms ready.

So the aforesaid Maijeaijs,[226] numbering twenty thousand, came to
attack us unawares, but they did not do us much harm. On the contrary,
in this conflict, more than one thousand of their men were left dead;
and they fled and we pursued them to their town, but we did not find
anything therein, not so much as their wives and children. Then our
commander, taking with him one hundred and fifty gunners and two
thousand five hundred Indian Carios, ordered us to follow the Maijeaijs,
which we did for three days and two nights together, taking no more rest
than the time necessary for our dinner and four or five hours for sleep
at night.

  [226] Mbaiás.

The third day we suddenly came upon the Maijaijs,[227] with their women
and children gathered together in a forest with them; these were not the
people we sought, but their friends. They did not fear at all our coming
to them. Nevertheless, the innocent had to pay for the guilty, for
when we lighted upon them we killed many, and took over three thousand
prisoners, men, women, and children; and, if it had been day-time
instead of night, none of them would have escaped, for there was a
goodly number of people gathered together on the hill, at the summit of
which was a great wood.

  [227] Mbaiás.

I, for my part, in this skirmish, captured over nineteen persons, men
and women, who were not at all old--I have always had more esteem for
young than for old people--also I took Indian mantles and other things
besides as my share of the booty. Then we returned to our camp and
remained there for eight days, because there was now plenty of victual.
The distance from these Maijaijs to Mount S. Fernando, where we left our
two ships, is seventy miles. Afterwards we went further, to a people
called Zchemui,[228] who are subject to the aforesaid Maijaijs, as here
at home the peasants are subject to their landlords.

  [228] Perhaps Chanés. To the tribe which Schmidt calls Zchemui, and to
  all the other tribes mentioned in his voyage north in search of _El
  Dorado_, he gives such queer and extraordinary names, that it is
  impossible to interpret them. De Barcia, the Spanish translator from
  the Latin version, who consulted other documents, declares that they
  are unintelligible, and generally puts down the equivalents as given
  by the Latin translator. The last named of those tribes is the one
  that Schmidt calls Machkokios, on arriving at the Salinas del Jaurú
  in lat. 16° S. Not far from there he finds another river, to which he
  gives the same name. This was the river Guapay. He goes across it
  and meets Spaniards, who tell him they belong to the Gobernacion
  (Government) of Pero Anzures. Irala stops there and sends messengers
  to the Governor of Peru, La Gasca, to whom he offers his services.
  La Gasca refuses them, and orders him back to the Gobernacion of the
  River Plate.

  The translators, who in other languages have tried to interpret these
  names, have done it in an arbitrary manner. The unintelligible names
  are the following: Peihoni, Tohanna, Symani, Barchkoni, Zeyhanni,
  Karchkoni, Siberi, Peijesseni, Jeronimus, Maigeni, Karchkockies,
  Marchkockios and rio Machkasies. None of them are Indian names.

On the way we found many fields sown with Turkish corn and other roots,
of which one can eat all the year round, for before one crop is stored
another is already ripe for harvest, and when this too is gathered it is
time to sow a third, so that there is always abundance of food.

We came to a little open space belonging to the Zchemui,[229] and, when
they saw us, they all fled away. We remained there for two days, and
found in that place, which is four miles from the Maijaijs,[230] plenty
to eat.

  [229] Chanés.

  [230] Mbaiás.

From thence we went in two days six miles to a nation named Thohonna; we
did not find any men here, but plenty to eat. They also are subjects to
the Maijaijs. Departing thence, we travelled for six days, and did not
find any people; but on the seventh we came to a nation called Peihoni.
They were gathered in great numbers, and their chief came to meet us
with a great multitude of people in a peaceful way. This chief besought
our commander that we should not enter their place, but that we should
stay outside in the place where he came to meet us. Our commander,
however, would not agree to that, and, will he nill he, straightway
entered their town; here we found plenty of meat and food, such as hens,
geese, deer, sheep, ostriches, parrots, _kuniglin_,[231] etc., not to
mention Turkish corn and other roots and fruits, all in great abundance.
But water is scarce, and there is no gold or silver. So we did not ask
for that, for fear that the other nations living further up should flee
away before we came to them.

  [231] These were probably guinea-pigs; cf. Acosta, _History of the
  Indies_ (Hakl. Soc.), p. 284.

With these Peihoni we stayed four days, and our commander asked them
many things about the nature and condition of the country.

From the Thohonna to these Peihoni the distance is twenty-four miles.
Departing from there we obtained from the Peihoni an interpreter and
guide, who showed us the road, in order that we might get water to
drink, for there is great scarcity of water in this country. At four
miles distance we came to a people called Maijegoni, and stayed one day
there, and again asked for an interpreter and guide to show us the way.
They were willing to do this, and they gave us our necessaries.

Departing from these we went further for eight miles and came to a
people called Marroni. They are a very numerous people, and received us
very well. We abode here two days with them, and received information of
the country. They also promised to show us the way. Then we went further
for four miles to a nation called Parroni, who have not much to eat.
They number three or four thousand fighting-men, and we remained only
one day amongst them.

From there we went twelve miles further to a nation named Symanni, where
a great multitude of people were gathered together on a high mountain.
Their village is surrounded with a thorny wood like a wall.[232] They
received us with their bows and arrows, and gave us tardes[233] to eat.
But it did not last long with them; they were soon compelled to leave
the place, but they burnt all down before leaving. We, however, found
enough to eat in the fields, and remained for three days there, seeking
for them in the woods and in the fields.

  [232] Probably a cactus-hedge.

  [233] Darts or javelins.

From there we went four days and came to a people called Barchkonis.
These did not await our coming, but as soon as we approached their town
betook themselves to flight; yet they could not escape us. We asked them
for food, and they brought us hens, geese, sheep, ostriches, deer, and
other necessaries, with which we were well satisfied; and we remained
four days among them to learn about the country.

From there we went twelve miles in three days to a people called
Zeyhannis. These had but little food, for the locusts had eaten up
everything; so we remained only one night there, and then went four
days' journey, twenty miles further, to a people called Karchkonis.
There also the locusts had been at work, but had not done so much harm
as in other places. We only abode one day among them, and took knowledge
of the country. They also told us that for a distance of thirty miles we
should find no water until we came to a people called Siberis.

We then took two Indians, who showed us the way, and in six days we came
to these Siberis; but many of our people died from thirst, although we
took water with us, on the journey from the Karchkonis. But in this
journey we found in certain places a root above ground, having great,
wide leaves[234] wherein the water remains and cannot get out, nor is
it consumed by them, exactly as if it were in a vase. One such root
contains nearly half a measure of water.

  [234] The author uses the word _Wurzel_ here and in other places for
  plant. Perhaps the Traveller's tree (_Urania speciosa_), with its
  graceful crown of plantain-like leaves, is here referred to.

So we came, at two o'clock in the night, to the aforesaid Siberis, who
would at once have fled with their wives and children. But our commander
caused them to be told, through an interpreter, that they should remain
in peace and quiet in their houses, and that they should not fear us.
These Siberis also suffered from a great scarcity of water, for they
have nothing else to drink. As it had not rained for three months they
were preparing a beverage out of a root called mandepore,[235] after
this manner: they take the said root and pound it in a mortar, and the
juice they obtain from it is like milk; but, if you have water at hand,
you may also prepare wine of this root.

  [235] Mandioca or Manioc.

In that place there was only one spring, where we had to station a guard
in order to look after the water and to give in a report on it. And our
commander saw fit to select me for this duty, that I might give out the
water after the measure that he had ordered, for the dearth was so great
that one would not ask for gold, or silver, or eatables, or anything
else, but for water. In this way I gained favour and grace among
noblemen and common folk alike, for I was not too sparing of it; at the
same time I had to be careful that we did not run short. There is not
to be found in all this land a running stream, but all the water is
collected in cisterns. These Siberis also wage war with other Indians
for the sake of water.

With this people we remained two days, not knowing what to do, whether
we should advance or go back; we therefore drew lots to decide the
question. Meanwhile our commander asked the Siberis about the country,
and they answered that we should have to go six days to reach a people
called Peijssenos, and that on our way we should find two rivulets of
drinkable water, and also the aforesaid Cardes.[236]

  [236] From the Spanish word _Cardos_--"thistle"--the shoots of which
  are eaten and quench the thirst.

We then began our journey, and took some Siberis with us to show the
way. Three days' journey from their place these Siberis fled away one
night, and we did not see them any more. So we had to find out the
way for ourselves, and afterwards came to the Peijssenos, who put
themselves on their defence, and refused to become friends with us. But
this did not help them much; by the grace of God we mastered them and
took their town, and put them to flight. However, we made several
prisoners in this skirmish, who told us how that they had had in their
town three Spaniards, one of whom was named Hieronimus, who had been a
drummer of Petro Manchossa.[237] These three Spaniards had been left
sick there by the late Johann Eijollas,[238] amongst the aforesaid
Peijssenos.

  [237] Don Pedro de Mendoza.

  [238] Juan de Ayolas.

The Peijssenos killed these three Spaniards four days before we arrived,
after they had heard of our coming through the Siberis; they were,
however, well punished by us for it, for we remained fourteen days in
their town, and sought them out and found them, but not all of them, in
a certain wood. We killed all these, and took prisoners the rest, the
lesser part, who escaped. Those whom we took prisoners were very willing
in showing us the country. Then our commander took note of all their
sayings, which were of good avail. Namely, they told us that we would
have four days' journey, or sixteen miles to go, before reaching a
people called Maigenos.

When we reached the Maigenos, they put themselves on their defence,
and refused to be friendly with us. Their town was on a little hill,
surrounded by a thick, thorny hedge, as high as a man might reach with
his sword. We Christians attacked this town, along with the Carios, on
two sides. But in this assault twelve Christians and several of the
Carios were killed before we won the place.

Now, seeing that we were masters of their town, the Maigenos burned it
down themselves, and speedily fled away, several of whom, as may be
readily believed, had to die. Three days afterwards, five hundred Carios
rose secretly, we knowing nothing about it, and took their bows and
arrows, and having gone two or three miles from our camp, met the
Maigenos who were fleeing. And these two people fought so desperately,
that the Carios lost over three hundred men, and the Maigenos so many,
that it is not possible to describe it, for they covered the space of
a whole mile. But the Carios sent messengers to our commander, and
besought him to come to their rescue because they were lying in the
forest, and were unable to advance or retire, being beleaguered on all
sides by the Maigenos.

As soon as our commander heard of this, without a moment's delay he
caused the horses, one hundred and fifty Christians, together with one
thousand of our Carios, to be sent, the other people remaining in
the camp to defend it, if necessary, in order that our enemies, the
Maigenos, might not enter and overthrow it in our absence.

So there went out to help our friends, the Carios, with the abovesaid
horses, one hundred and fifty Christians and one thousand Carios. But as
soon as the Maigenos saw us coming, they broke up their camp and fled
away swiftly, but we pursued them, without, however, being able to
overtake them. How it befell them at the last, when we returned to the
town whence we had come, will be presently narrated.

So we came to the Carios, and found a wonderful number of them and of
their enemies, the Maigenos, lying dead. Our friends, the Carios, those
who were still alive, were greatly pleased that we were come to help
them.

After that we returned with them to our camp and abode there four days,
for we had plenty to eat and all things needful in this town of the
Maigenos.

We then resolved to undertake our decisive journey, having now knowledge
of the country. So we journeyed for thirteen consecutive days, that is
to say, according to our judgment, about seventy-two miles, and came
to a nation named Karchkockios; and when we were _en route_ the first
nine days we came to a region six miles either way, on which there
was nothing but good salt as thick as if it had snowed, and that salt
remains winter and summer.[239]

  [239] This place is the Salinas del Jaurú (salt lakes of Jaurú).

We remained two days in this salt region, not knowing how to come out
of it or how to take the right way to continue our journey. But God
Almighty gave us His grace that we found the right way, and in four days
we came to a people called Karchkockios, and when we were at only four
miles distance from their town, our commander sent in advance fifty
Christians and five hundred Carios that they might provide lodging for
us.

Now when we had entered the town, we found a numerous people together,
the like of which we had not as yet seen in all our journey, and we were
put somewhat in fear by it. Seeing this, we sent one of our men back
to our commander, to tell him how matters were, and that he might come
speedily to our help.

And when our commander heard these tidings, he set forward with all his
people on the very same night, and by the morning, between three and
four o'clock, he was in the midst of us; but the Karchkockios, supposing
that there were not more of us than they had seen the evening before,
promised themselves the victory.

But when they were aware that our commander had come with more people
they were very sad and sorrowful, and showed us all possible kindness
and goodwill, for they could have done nothing more, and feared for
their wives and children and their village. Meanwhile they brought us
venison, geese, sheep, ostriches, ducks, conies, and other game and
fowl, as well as Turkish corn, wheat, rice, and other roots which abound
in their country. The men wear a round blue stone in their lips, as
broad as a draughtsman. Their weapons are darts, bows and arrows, and
targets made of _amida_ hide. Their wives have a small hole in their
lips in which they insert a green or grey crystal. They wear a cotton
waistcloth about the size of a shirt, but without sleeves. They are
beautiful women, and do nothing but sew and keep house; the men till the
fields and provide all kinds of food.

From there we went to the Machkockios[240] and took some of the
Karchkockios with us to show us the way. And after three days'
journeying from this place the said Karchkockios[241] left us secretly,
but we nevertheless continued our journey and came to a river named
Machkasis, one mile and a half broad; and we did not know how to pass
over it safely; but with God's grace we passed it well in the following
way: for every two persons we made a raft of wood and branches, whereon
being carried down the river they came to the other side; and in this
passage four of our people were drowned. God be merciful to them and to
us. Amen.

  [240] Irala, in his letter to the King, of July 24, 1555, calls the
  territory where he arrived Tamacoxas; and Ruy Diaz de Guzman calls it
  Samocosis. This is what Schmidt means.

  [241] Tamacoxas.

This river has good fish in it. Many tigers are also found in the
neighbourhood. This river is only four miles distant from the
Machkockios.

When we had approached within one mile of the Machkasis the inhabitants
came forth to meet us, and received us very well, and soon began talking
Spanish with us; whereat we were astonished, and asked them whose
subjects they were and who was their lord; they answered our commander
and us, that they were the subjects of a Spanish nobleman, whose name
was Peter Asuelles.[242]

  [242] Pero Anzures de Campo Redondo, one of the officers of Pizarro,
  the conqueror of Peru, who was sent to conquer the territory of the
  Chunchos, east of the river Arumaya, and between the Beni and the
  Guapay.

Upon entering their village we found their children, and some of the
men and women, swarming with very little vermin, like our fleas. These
little vermin, if they lay hold of the toes, or any other part of the
body, gnaw and enter always more and more deeply into the flesh, and at
length become worms, such as are found in our filberts. If it be taken
in time the mischief may be prevented, but if overlooked too long, it
eats the whole toes away. I could write very much about it.[243]

  [243] This is the _nigua_, in Guaraní, called _pique_ in Brazil, where
  it is very plentiful, and chiefly attacks the negroes. In tropical
  Africa it is vulgarly known as the "Jigger".

From our often-mentioned town of Noster Signora Desumsion to this
village of the Machkasis the distance by land is three hundred and
seventy-two miles.[244]

  [244] The city of Asuncion del Paraguai is in lat. 25° 17' S., and the
  salt lakes of the Jaurú in lat. 16°. The distance by land between them
  is about 700 English miles.

Now, when we had stayed twenty days in this place of the Machkasis, we
received a letter from a city called Lieme[245] in Peru, from H. I. M.
Supreme Stadthalter there named Presende or Licentiat de Cascha,[246]
who had caused Consaillo Pisere[247] to be beheaded, besides other
noblemen whom he caused to be beheaded along with him, or to be sent to
the galleys, because the said Consaillo Pisere would not be obedient to
him the Licentiate de Cascha, but was rebellious along with the country
against H. I. Majesty.

  [245] Lima.

  [246] El Presidente Licenciado La Gasca.

  [247] Gonzalo Pizarro.

So it often happens that someone makes more, or takes more power than
has been delegated to him from his master; and so it is in this world. I
certainly think that H. I. Majesty would have granted the said Pisere
his life, if H. I. Majesty had himself arrested him. He was vexed that
another lord had been placed in authority over his own land, for this
country of Peru, before God and man was legitimately Consaillo Pisere's,
because he, along with his brethren Margossen and Ernando Piseron,[248]
had discovered and conquered it first of all. This land is rightly
called the Rich Country, for all riches appertaining to H. I. Majesty
come from Peru, Nova Hispania, and Terra firma.

  [248] El Marqués Don Francisco and Hernando Pizarro.

But envy and hatred are so great in the world that one man wishes
nothing good to another. And so it happened to poor Consaillo Pisero,
who formerly had been a King, and afterwards had his head taken off. God
be merciful to him. Much could be written about this, but I have no time
for it.

Now, the above-mentioned letter was to the effect that, in name of H. I.
Majesty, our Commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla,[249] should not, by
any means whatever, depart from there, but should remain among the
Machkasis, and wait for further orders.

  [249] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

But it was really intended to this effect, that the governor, fearing
that we might excite a rebellion against him in the country, and
associate ourselves with those who had escaped and taken to flight into
the forest and mountain (and that would doubtless have happened if we
had met together again and we would have chased the governor out of the
country), entered into an agreement with our commander, and made him a
great present, in order to satisfy him and to get off alive. We soldiers
knew nothing about this compact; had we known of it we would have tied
our commander hand and foot together, and so transported him to Peru.

After this our commander sent four companions to Peru, whose names were
Nueste de Schaieses, Ungnade, Michael de Ruete, Abaije de Korchua.[250]
These four persons came to Peru in one month and a half.

  [250] The real names of those officers were: Nuflo de Chaves, Agustin
  de Ocampo, Miguel de Rutia, and Ruy Garcia.

Firstly they came to a people called Poduesis,[251] then to another
called Ruessken,[252] thirdly to Riodellaplata, and to the principal
town called Lieme.[253] These four are the principal and the richest
cities in Peru.

  [251] Potosi.

  [252] Cuzco.

  [253] Lima.

When those four companions came to the first town, Poduesis in Peru, the
two named Michael de Ruete and Abaije remained there, because of their
weakness, as they had fallen ill on the journey; the two others, Nueste
and Ungnade, rode post to Lieme to the governor. He received them well
and heard from them a report as to how matters were going on in the
country of Riodellaplata; then he ordered that they should be treated in
the best possible way, and gave them each two thousand ducats.

Then the governor ordered Nueste de Schaieses[254] to write to his
commander that he should remain until further advice with his people
among the Machkasis,[255] but he should not take from them anything nor
do them any harm, excepting with regard to food, although we knew very
well that they had silver, but being the subjects of a Spaniard, we
should not do them any injury.

  [254] Nuflo de Chaves.

  [255] Tamacoxas: cf. _supra_, p. 73, _note_.

But this post of the governor was waylaid by a Spaniard named Parnawuie,
by order of our commander, who feared that another commander might come
from Peru to rule over his people; and indeed another one had already
been appointed. Therefore our commander sent out on the roads the said
Parnawuie and ordered him, if there were any letters, to bring them with
him to where he was staying with the Carios; and this was accordingly
done.

Our commander had arranged so badly that owing to the scarcity of
victual we could not remain any longer among the Machkasis, for we had
only enough provisions to last for one month. If we had only known that
we were going to have both victual and a governor, we would not have
removed from there, and we would have found food and ways and means to
remain; but there is nothing but knavery in this world. Afterwards we
went back again to the Karchkockios.

I should also have mentioned that the country of the Machkasis is so
fertile that I have never seen the like of it before. For if an Indian
goes forth into the forest, and makes a hole with an hatchet in the
first tree he comes across, five or six measures of honey flow out of
it, as pure as our mead. The bees that make this honey are very small
and do not sting.[256] Their honey may be eaten with bread, or in any
other manner. Good wine is also prepared from it, like the mead here in
Germany, and even better.

  [256] This description is greatly exaggerated. The bees make their
  hives (called in Guaraní _camoati_) on the branches of the trees, and
  it is from the hive, of course, not from the tree, that the honey is
  taken.

Now, when we came to the said Karchkockios, these Indians had all fled
away with wives and children, and were afraid of us, but it would
have been better for them to have remained in their villages; for our
commander soon sent other Indians after them, and bade them return,
saying that they ought not to fear, that no harm would be done to them;
they would not, however, take heed of our request, but invited us to
leave their village, threatening in case of our refusal to drive us out
of it by force.

Having heard this, we soon made our preparations and went out against
them. However, some of us were of opinion to send a message to our
commander and advise him not to march against them, because this might
bring about a great want in the land; in case we had to move from
Peru to Riodellaplata, for then we would have no provisions. But our
commander and the whole community would not accept that proposal, but
preferred the above-mentioned advice, and went out against the said
Karchkockios. And when we arrived at the distance of half-a-mile from
them, we found that they had pitched their camp between two hills
covered with forest; so that, if we conquered them, they might the more
easily escape us. But it did not befall them well, for those we reached
had to die at our hands or to become our slaves. We enslaved in this
skirmish over one thousand, without reckoning those men, women, and
children that were killed.

Afterwards we remained two months in this village, which was as great
as five or six others joined together. We then went on further, to the
place where we left the two aforesaid mentioned ships, and we were one
year and a half on the journey, always engaged in one war after another,
and took prisoners more than twelve thousand persons, all of whom became
our slaves. I had for my share about fifty men, women, and children.

And when we came to the ships, the people that had been left on these
bergentines informed us how, during our absence, a commander, Diego
Abriego of Sievilla,[257] in Spain, on the one side, and a commander, J.
Francisco Manchossa,[258] who had been left in charge of the two ships
by our chief commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla,[259] during his absence
on the other side, had begun a great quarrel. They told us that Diego de
Abriego claimed to rule over them, while Johann Franciscus Manchossa,
in his capacity as appointed commander and substitute of Martin Domingo
Eijolla, would not consent to let him do this; and so the beggars-dance
began between them, until at last Diego de Abriego[260] won the victory,
and even took off the head of Johann Francisco Manchossa. From that
moment he made much noise in the country, and proposed to march against
us. First, he fortified himself in the town, and when we came along
with our commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla, before the said town, he
refused to let our commander in, or to surrender the town, or even still
less to recognise him as his master.

  [257] Diego de Abrego of Seville.

  [258] Don Francisco de Mendoza.

  [259] Domingo Martinez de Irala.

  [260] This name is written Abreu and Abrego in different chronicles
  and documents. I believe the right name is Diego de Abrego.

Our commander having heard this, we beleaguered the town Noster Signora
Desumsion. But the soldiers who were in that town, seeing that we meant
business, came day after day to us in the open field, and prayed our
commander for mercy. Diego de Abriego, having noticed that he could not
trust his people, and fearing that we might enter the town by night
through treason, which would have certainly happened, took counsel with
his best companions and friends, and asked who would go out of the town
along with him. About fifty men went out with him; the others came to
our commander, as soon as Diego de Abriego had left, and surrendered,
and begged for mercy. The commander promised them mercy, and entered
the town. But the said Diego de Abriego fled with the fifty Christians
thirty miles away, so that we could do them no harm. In this way these
two commanders made war one against the other for two full years; so
much so, that one was never sure of the other, for Diego de Abriego
never remained long in the same place, being here to-day, there
to-morrow; and where he was able to do us harm, he did it, for he
resembled very much a highway robber--in short, in order to have peace,
our commander was compelled to come to terms with him, and arranged a
marriage with his two daughters, whom he gave to two cousins of Diego
de Abriego, the one of whom was named Albernunzo Richkell, and the other
Franciscus Fergere,[261] and when this marriage was arranged we had
peace at last.

  [261] The names of these two Spaniards, according to Ruy Diaz de
  Guzman, author of _La Argentina_ (1612), and grandson of Irala, were
  Alonso Riquelme de Guzman (father of Ruy Diaz), and Francisco Ortiz de
  Vergara. There were four marriages, and not two, as Schmidt says. The
  other two Spaniards were Gonzalo de Mendoza and Pedro Segura. Irala's
  daughters were by Indian women, his captives.

At the same time I received a letter from Sievilla in Spain, from the
agent of Fugger, named Christoff Keyser, to say that Sebastian Neidhart
had written to him by order of my late brother, Thomas Schmidt, asking
if there was no possibility of my returning to Spain. That was what the
said Christoff Keyser had constantly solicited, and caused this letter
to be sent to me, in the year 1552, on the second day of July, or St.
Jacob's day.[262]

  [262] St. James's Day is on the 25th of July. I refer the reader to my
  _Introduction_ for some explanations about the Fuggers, Neidhart, etc.

Having read this letter, I immediately requested our commander, Martin
Domingo Eijolla, to grant me leave of absence. At first he refused
to concede it to me; but at length he was obliged to take into
consideration my long services, how I had faithfully served on land H.
I. Majesty, having oftentimes offered my life for him (Martin Domingo
Eijolla), and had never abandoned him. He considered all this, and
gave me leave, at the same time giving me letters for H. I. Majesty,
informing H. I. Majesty how matters stood in Riodellaplata, and all that
had happened there during that time. These letters were delivered by
me at Sievilla to H. I. Majesty's councillors, to whom I reported also
verbally about the country.

And having now made all my preparations for the journey, I took leave
of my commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla, and all my good companions and
friends, and took with me twenty of the Carios Indians, who had to carry
all that I had need of for this long journey (and anyone may judge for
himself how many things one must necessarily have for such a journey).

Eight days before my departure a man came from Presilia[263] and
brought the news that a ship had arrived there from Lisbon, in Portugal,
belonging to the honourable and wise gentleman, Johann von Hulst, a
merchant at Lisbon, and an agent of Erasmus Schetzen of Anttorff.[264]

  [263] Brazil.

  [264] Antwerp.

Having heard all that he had to say, I set out on my journey, in the
name of God Almighty, in the year 1552, on the twenty-sixth of December,
St. Stephen's Day. And I left Riodellaplata[265] from the town Noster
Signora desumsion with twenty Indians in two canoes. We firstly
came, after twenty-six miles distance, to a place called Jubericha
Sabaija[266]; in that place four other companions joined themselves to
me--two Spaniards and two Portuguese, but they were without grant of
leave from the commander.

  [265] Rio de la Plata was the official name of this country, _i.e._,
  _Gobernacion del Rio de la Plata_. In the year 1618 it was divided
  into three provinces--Paraguai, Guaira, and Buenos Ayres.

  [266] Juberich Sabaije has been identified with Yeruquihaba; cf.
  _supra_, p. 58.

From there we went off together, and at the end of fifteen miles came to
a place called Gabaretha.[267] After this we went sixteen miles in four
days to a place called Bareia,[267] and from there in nine days or
fifty-four miles we came to a place called Bareda,[267] where we stayed
for two days, in search of victual and canoes, because we had to go up
the river Paranaw[268] for a distance of one thousand miles; and then we
came to a place called Gienugia,[267] where we remained four days. As far
as this place the country belongs to H. I. Majesty, and is peopled by
the Carios.

  [267] These names are not known, and it is impossible to find out what
  Schmidt meant.

  [268] Paraná.

Beyond it begins the territory of the King of Portugal, or the land of
the Tapis.[269] We had now to leave the Paranaw, and our canoes, and
walk to the Tapis; for six weeks we traversed deserts, mountains, and
valleys, and could not sleep for fear of the wild beasts. From the
said place, Gienugia, to these Tapis the distance is one hundred and
twenty-six miles. This nation of Tapis eat their enemies, have no other
occupation but waging war, and when they have conquered their enemies,
they bring them to their place as prisoners, with great solemnity, as
they do here in Germany at the time of a marriage. And when they prepare
to slaughter their captives they make a great ceremony. They give their
prisoner all he wishes for or lusts after: women with whom he may have
intercourse, and meals to his heart's content, up to the hour that he
has to die. Their delight and joy consist in making war. They drink and
eat enormously, are full day and night; they are also fond of dancing,
and lead such an Epicurean life that it is not possible to describe
it. It is a fierce, ambitious, and arrogant people; they make wine of
Turkish corn, becoming as drunk upon it as if they were drinking the
best of wines. They speak the same language as the Carios, with only a
very slight difference.

  [269] _Tapis_, writes here Schmidt, and this is the Guaraní name of
  the tribes south of Brazil, as was given by Father Anchieta and others
  contemporary to the conquest. The true spelling is Tapii. Afterwards
  this word was corrupted into Tupi, or Tupin, and Tape.

Next we came to a place called Karieseba, where the inhabitants are also
Tapis; these wage war against the Christians, whereas those we have
spoken of are friends with them.

So we came, on Palm Sunday, at four miles distance from a place, where I
became aware that we had to be on our guard against those of Karieseba,
for we were by this time in great want of victual. We had, however,
intended to go somewhat farther for victual's sake, but we could not
withhold two of our companions, who, despite our warnings, entered the
place. We promised them to wait, and did so; but before they could enter
the place they were killed and afterwards eaten. God have mercy on them.
Amen.

Then these same Indians came as near as thirty paces from us, along
with fifty men. They wore the clothes of the Christians, and they stood
still and began parleying with us. Among these Indians, if anyone stands
still at a few paces distance from his enemy and talks to him, he has
usually nothing very good in his mind.

Seeing this, we put ourselves on our defence as well as we could, and
asked of them what had become of our companions. They told us they were
in their town, and invited us also to enter it. But we would not do so,
for we perfectly well understood their malice.

Then they shot at us with their bows, but they resisted not long, and
soon fled away to their town, whence they came out again with six
hundred men against us. We had no other protection than a great wood,
our four guns, and the sixty[270] Indians of the Carios who had come
with us from Noster Signora desumsion. Nevertheless, we defended
ourselves four days and four nights, always shooting one at another,
and in the fourth night we secretly left the wood and went off, because
we had not much to eat, and our enemies had become too strong for us, as
the saying goes: Many dogs cause the death of the hare.

  [270] Schmidt speaks of _twenty_, not _sixty_, men with whom he set
  out.

Thence we travelled six days through wild forests, more lonely than any
I had ever seen, and I may say that I have travelled far and wide. We
had nothing to eat, and had to satisfy ourselves with roots and honey
that we found here and there. We could not even afford the necessary
time to hunt for game, so fearful were we that the enemy might overtake
us by night.

At length we came to a nation called Bijessija,[271] where we remained
four days and took victual, but we dared not enter the place because we
were so few.

  [271] Mbiaçai, the land opposite the island of Santa Catalina.

In this country there is a river called Urquaie,[272] wherein we have
seen snakes which are called in Spanish Schue Eiiba Thuescha.[273] They
are fourteen paces in length and two fathoms thick in the middle of the
body. They do great harm, to wit, when a man takes a bath or an animal
drinks in a river or would swim across it, such a snake, swimming under
water, comes to the man or animal, puts its tail around them under water
and there eats them. That animal has always its head above water, in
order to watch around for man or beast.

  [272] Uruguay.

  [273] This extraordinary name is not Spanish. The great snake
  described by Schmidt must be the Boa, which lives near the
  watering-places waiting for its prey.

From there we went for a whole month further a distance of one hundred
miles, and came to a place called Schelebethueba,[274] where we remained
three days, for we were exceedingly tired and had no longer anything to
eat, our principal food being honey. We were all consequently very weak,
and everyone can imagine what dreadfully poor and miserable lives we
passed in such a journey, especially as regards eating and drinking and
sleeping. The bed which every one of us took with him weighed four or
five pounds; it was of cotton, and made like a net. It is tied to two
trees, and one man lies down in it. This is done in the forest, under
the blue sky; for if there are not many Christians travelling overland
together in India, it is better and safer to remain in the forest than
to enter the houses and villages of the Indians.

  [274] No place of this name in all Brazil.

We next came to a place which belongs to the Christians, whose chief
was called Johann Reinmelle.[275] Fortunately for us he was not at home,
for this place certainly appeared to me to be a robbers' haunt. The said
chief was at this time gone to another Christian at Vicenda[276] in
order to make an agreement. Both are (with eight hundred Christians
living in the two villages) subjects of the King of Portugal, and the
aforesaid Johann Reinmelle has, according to his own account, lived,
ruled, made war, and conquered in India for a period of four hundred
(forty) years. Therefore, he may legitimately claim to rule the land for
another. And because the Portuguese will not recognise his authority,
they wage war. This said Reinmelle can, in one single day, gather around
him five thousand Indians, whereas the king is not able to bring two
thousand together, so much power and consideration has he got in the
country.

  [275] Juan Ramallo. This man was an exiled outlaw, left probably by
  Juan Diaz de Solis and Vicente Yanez Pinzon on the first voyage of
  discovery, which was made as far as 40° S., in 1508. Many travellers
  of that time met Ramallo on the coast of San Vicente, living there as
  a cacique with a large tribe of his children. The travellers called
  him the _bachiller_. Hans Staden speaks of two of his sons, calling
  them Diego de Praga and Domingo de Praga, because Staden made
  mistakes in all names of persons and places, just as Schmidt did.
  The translators of his book into Latin interpret Ramallo's name as
  Reinuelle, and M. Ternaux Compans makes it French, and spells it
  Reinvielle. Ramallo's family was the founder of Piratininga, the
  origin of the city of San Paulo, in Brazil.

  [276] San Vicente, on the coast of the province of San Paulo. It was
  founded in 1531 by Martin Affonzo de Souza, and was the first
  Portuguese colony in Brazil.

When we came to the village, the son of the said Reinmelle was there,
and he received us very well, though we had to look closer after him
than after the Indians. But all went well, and no harm happened to us;
therefore we thank God, the eternal Creator, through Jesus Christ, His
only Son, who helped us so mercifully there and everywhere.

We then went farther to a little town called S. Vicenda at twenty miles
distance, where we arrived on July[277] 13th, 1553, St. Anthony's day,
and found there a Portuguese ship laden with sugar, Brazilian wood and
wool, belonging to Erasmus Schetzen. His factor is at Lisbon, and is
called Johann von Hulsen, and he has another factor in Vicenda whose
name is Peter Rössel.[278]

  [277] June.

  [278] Peter Rossel, or Rösel, is mentioned by Hans Staden; cf. _The
  Captivity of Hans Staden_ (Hakl. Soc.), p. 169.

Messrs. Schetzen and Johann von Hulsen own a good number of villages and
sugar factories in that place, where sugar is made all the year round.

Peter Rössel received me very friendly, and showed me great honour. He
introduced me also to the sailors, in order that I might be well treated
and leave with the first, and recommended me to them. To their honour be
it said, they followed his recommendation. We remained eleven more days
in the town of Vicenda in order to prepare and to provide ourselves
with all necessaries that are wanted at sea. And we were six months
travelling a distance of four hundred and seventy-six miles, from the
town Signora desumsion to the town of Vicenda, in Brazil.

Afterwards, when we were ready, we set forth on our journey from the
town of St. Vicenda on the 24th day of June, St. John's Day, 1553. We
were fourteen days at sea, because we had never any good wind, but
always storms and tempests, so that we did not know where we were.
Then the main-top got broken, and, water pouring into the ship, we had
to return to land, and came to a seaport named Spiritu Sanctu,[279]
situated in Brazil, in India, and belonging to the King of Portugal.
There are Christians living in that town with their wives and children,
and they make sugar. They also have cotton-wool and Brazilian wood,
besides other kinds of wood that are found there.

  [279] Espiritu Santo, a small maritime province with a bay and port of
  the same name, north of Rio de Janeiro.

Between S. Vicenda and Spiritu Sancto there are plenty of whales, which
do great harm; for instance, when small ships sail from one port to
another (these small ships are anyhow somewhat larger than the greatest
ships at home), these whales come forward in troops and fight one
another, then they drown the ship, taking it down along with the men.

These whales constantly spit water out of their mouth, as much at one
time as a Frankish barrel would contain. This the whale does every time
that he puts his head under water and comes up again, by day and by
night, and he who never saw one before believes that he sees a heap of
stones. Much more might be written about this fish. There are many other
rare fish and sea wonders of which one could not write too much, but I
really cannot speak of all.

There is another great fish, called in Spanish _Sumere_, and in German
straw-fish, of which one cannot say too much. It is such a powerful fish
that it does considerable harm to ships in various parts. When there is
no wind, and the ships are compelled to lie still, not being able to go
forward or backward, then this fish comes with such a tremendous blow on
the ships, that all things tremble; when this happens, one has to throw
one or two barrels into the sea; then the fishes go to these barrels,
play with them, and leave the ships.

Another great fish, called the _Peischo Spaide_,[280] and in German
knife-fish, does a great deal of harm to the other fishes, and when
these fishes battle against each other, it is exactly as if two horses
ran full tilt together here on land. This is very amusing to watch at
sea. But after these fishes thus struggle with one another, a great
storm generally follows.

  [280] Cf. _ante_, p. 5.

So there is also another great and bad fish which takes the mastery
over all the others of which I have been speaking, in struggling and
battling. Its name is _Pesche de serre_,[281] and in German saw-fish;
further, there are a great number more, but I cannot give their
names. There are also flying fishes and other great fishes called
_Toningen_.[282]

  [281] _Ibid._

  [282] Tonina (tunny fish).

We sailed for four months together on the sea, without seeing any
land at all, and we conveyed goods from the aforesaid Spiritu Sancto.
Afterwards we came to an island called Teste de Terzero,[283] where we
again took fresh victual and remained there for two days. This island
belongs to the King of Portugal.

  [283] Terceira, one of the Azores.

From there we sailed to Lisbon in fourteen days, arriving on the 30th
September 1553, St. Hieronymus' day, and remained fourteen days in the
town, where two Indians whom I had taken with me died.

Thence I posted to Seville in six days; the distance being seventy-two
miles. I remained there four weeks till the ships were prepared, when
I left Seville by water, and in two days arrived at the town of S.
Lucas,[284] where I passed the night.

  [284] San Lucar.

From there I travelled one day by land and arrived at a town called
Porta Sancto Maria,[285] and from there a second day also by land to
another town, four miles over the water, called Kalles,[286] where there
were twenty-five Dutch ships ready to sail to the Netherlands; all great
ships called _Hulcken_.[287]

  [285] Puerto de Santa Maria.

  [286] Cadiz.

  [287] Large merchantmen. The word "hulk" expresses a different
  meaning, nearer the original, derived from the Greek ????? [holkas],
  a ship which is towed, from ?????? [helkein], to draw, drag. Hence the
  sense of something bulky or unwieldy.

One of these twenty-five ships was a beautiful newly built vessel, which
had only made one voyage from Antorff[288] to Spain; the merchants
advised me to sail with that ship, of which the captain was named
Heinrich Schetz. He was an honest and religious man, with whom I now
came to terms as to the payment for the voyage and the victual and other
things necessary on sea. I finally agreed with him and provisioned
myself during the same night, and had my plunder, bread, and several
other things, as well as the parrots which I brought from India, all put
on board. And, lastly, I arranged with him that he should tell me the
time of departure, which he faithfully promised me, and that he would
not sail without me, but would certainly let me know.

  [288] Antwerp.

However, the said skipper that very night drank somewhat too much, so
that he forgot all about me and left me alone in the lodgings. Two hours
before daylight the steersman, who had the command of the ship, had the
anchor lifted and sailed away, and in the morning when I looked out for
the ship it was already a mile off. So I had to see after another and
make terms with its skipper, to whom I had to give as much as to the
former.

Then we soon sailed away along with the other twenty-four ships and
had a fairly good wind the first three days, but afterwards we had a
contrary wind, so much so that we were unable to continue our voyage.
We remained in great danger for five days and hoped for better weather,
but the longer we hoped, the more violent became the sea, so we had to
return to where we came from.

Now it is the custom at sea for the mariners and skippers to elect for
themselves a chief commander, called in Spanish _Almiranda_.[289] This
commander directs all the ships, and all his orders have to be obeyed.
The mariners and skippers have to swear an oath to the effect that they
will not separate from one another, for H. I. Majesty had ordered that
no less than twenty ships should sail from Spain to the Netherlands,
because there was war between H. I. Majesty and the King of France.

  [289] The Spanish word is Almirante.

Further, it is also usual at sea that one ship should not separate from
another for more than the distance of one mile, and at sunrise and
sunset that the ships should all come together, and salute the admiral
with three or four shots, and this must be done twice a day.

The admiral is bound to have on the stern of his ship two iron lanterns,
called _farol_,[290] which are alight all night through, and the others
have to follow the ship that shows this light, and must not separate
from each other.

  [290] "Farol" is a Spanish word, meaning a box or case with sides of
  glass or some other transparent substance, for placing a light in, so
  that it may not be extinguished by the wind.

So also the admiral tells the others every night whither he is sailing,
in order that if a storm should blow up, they may know what direction or
what wind the admiral has taken, and not lose each other.

When we had to put back to port, as I have said, there was the ship of
Heinrich Schetzen (whereon all my plunder was, he who had forgotten me
altogether at Kalles[291]) behind all the other ships; and when we had
come within one mile of Kalles it was dark and night, and the admiral
had to light his lanterns, in order that the ships might follow him.

  [291] Cadiz.

When we reached Kalles each skipper laid out his anchor in the sea, and
the admiral removed his lanterns.

Then a fire was lit on shore with the best intention, but it was the
cause of disaster to Heinrich Schetzen and his ship. The fire was made
near a mill within gunshot of Kalles, and Schetzen sailed straight
towards it, believing it to be the admiral's light, and when he had
nearly reached it, he struck upon the rocks which stood there in the sea
and had his ship shivered into a hundred thousand pieces, and in half a
quarter of an hour men and goods had all perished. Twenty-two persons
were drowned, only the steersman and skipper escaping death on a thick
tree. Six trunks with gold and silver belonging to H. I. Majesty, and a
large quantity of merchandise belonging to the merchants, were also
lost.

Therefore I say to God be everlasting praise and thanks, because He has
once again guided and protected me so mercifully, that I did not go on
board that ship.

We afterwards remained for two days at Kalles, and departed thence on
S. Andrea's[292] day for Antorff.[293] On this voyage we had very bad
weather and dreadful tempests, so that the mariners said that for twenty
years, or for so long a time as they had been at sea, they had never
seen such heavy storms nor heard of any storms that had lasted so long.

  [292] St. Andrew's.

  [293] Antwerp.

When we came to England, into a port called Wydt,[294] all our yards and
top-sails had been carried away. And if this voyage had lasted a little
longer, not one of the twenty-four ships would have escaped, but for the
special providence of our Lord God.

  [294] Isle of Wight.

Moreover, on New Year's Day, 1554, and on the Holy Three Kings' Day,
eight ships were miserably wrecked with men and goods--an awful sight
indeed, for every man on board was drowned.

This happened between France and England. God Almighty be merciful to
them all and to us, through Christ His eternal Son. Amen.

We remained four days in that port Wydt in England, and from there we
sailed for Brabant, and came in four days to Armuia,[295] which is a
town in Seeland,[296] where the great ships lie. It is seventy-four
miles from Wydt, and from there we sailed to Antorff, which is
twenty-four miles off, and arrived there on January the 26th, 1554.

  [295] Armeven.

  [296] Zeeland.

God be praised everlastingly, He who so mercifully gave me such a
prosperous voyage.

Commentaries of Alvar Nunez Cabeza
de Vaca, governor of the Rio de la Plata.




CHAPTER THE FIRST.

    _Of the Commentaries of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca._


SINCE it pleased God to deliver Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca from
captivity, and from the troubles that he underwent for ten years in
Florida, he came to these kingdoms in the year of our Lord 1537, where
he remained till the year 1540; in which year there came to this court
of His Majesty some persons from the river La Plata to inform His
Majesty of what had happened to the army which Don Pedro de Mendoza had
taken there, and of the danger those were in who had survived, and to
supplicate that His Majesty would be pleased to aid and succour them
before they perished (as but few of them remained). And when His Majesty
knew of it, he ordered that a certain arrangement and capitulation
should be made with Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, in order that he
might go to their relief. This arrangement and capitulation was there
effected, the said Cabeza de Vaca offering to go to their assistance,
and undertaking to expend for that journey and relief, in horses, arms,
apparel and provisions, as well as other things, eight thousand ducats.
And in consideration of this treaty thus entered into, His Majesty
favoured him with the governorship and general captaincy of that land
and province, and with the title of Adelantado.[297] It pleased also His
Majesty to grant to him the twelfth part of everything that was in that
land and province, and of all that entered and went out of it, provided
that the aforesaid Alvar Nunez expended on that expedition the sum
of eight thousand ducats as aforesaid. And so, in fulfilment of the
agreement entered into with His Majesty, he started immediately for
Seville in order to put the agreement into execution, and to make
provision for the aforesaid assistance and armament. And to this effect
he bought two vessels and a caravel, together with another that was in
waiting for him at Canaria. One of these vessels was newly arrived from
her first voyage and was of three hundred and fifty tons burden, and the
other was of one hundred and fifty tons. He equipped these vessels very
well and supplied them with plenty of commodities, and engaged pilots
and sailors, and four hundred soldiers well trained to the use of arms,
and such as were wanted for that relief; and all that volunteered for
that expedition were provided with a double set of arms. In order to
complete his purchases and supplies he remained there from the month of
May till the end of September, when the ships were ready to sail. But
the weather being unfavourable, he was detained in the city of Cadiz
from the end of September till the 2nd of November, on which day he set
sail and made his voyage, and in nine days arrived at the island of La
Palma, where he disembarked with all his people, and remained there
twenty-five days, waiting for a favourable wind to continue his voyage.
At the end of this time he sailed towards Cape Verde. In this voyage the
ship, the _Capitana_, made so much water that it rose to the height of
ten spans in the hold of the vessel. Five hundred quintals of biscuits
were damaged, and much oil was lost, besides other commodities. This
accident caused them great trouble, and they kept at the pumps day and
night till they arrived at the island of St. Iago (one of the Cape Verde
Islands). Here they disembarked and landed the horses, in order that
they might refresh themselves and rest from their fatigues, and because
it was necessary to unload the vessel in order to stop the leak. And
after she had been unloaded the master stopped the leak (for he was the
best diver in Spain). They sailed from La Palma to Cape Verde in ten
days, for they are 300 leagues apart. In this island the harbour is
very bad because of the many sharp, sunken rocks that fray the cables
attached to the anchors, and when they pull on them in order to raise
the anchors these remain in the rocks. And for this reason the sailors
have a saying that there are many rats in that harbour, which gnaw the
cables asunder; and because of this, it is a very dangerous harbour
for vessels stationed there in the event of a storm. This island is
unhealthy and full of infections in the winter, so much so that the
greater part of those who go ashore there die in a few days, soon after
their arrival. The armada, however, remained there twenty-five days,
during which not a single man died; and the inhabitants were much
astonished at this, and took it as a great marvel. And the inhabitants
gave them a good reception; and this island is very rich, and there are
more doubloons in it than reales,[298] for those who traffic there for
negroes were giving a doubloon for twenty reales.

  [297] Governor of province on the frontiers and in newly-discovered
  countries.

  [298] The meaning of this is that gold was more plentiful in the
  island of St. Iago than silver.




CHAPTER THE SECOND.

    _How we departed from the island of Cabo Verde._


WHEN we had repaired the leak of the _Admiral_ ship, and purchased the
necessary supplies, such as water, meat, and other things, we embarked
and pursued our voyage and crossed the equinoctial line, and, continuing
our navigation, the master took stock of the water that was on board the
_Admiral_, and, out of a hundred barrels that had been stored, he found
no more than three left, and four hundred men and thirty horses had to
drink. And the governor, having seen the necessity we were in, ordered
the ship to land; and they were in search of it three days, and the
fourth day, one hour before dawn, a wonderful thing happened, and as it
is not beyond our purpose, I will relate it. It happened, as the vessels
were going towards land, they were on the point of striking some very
high rocks, and nobody would have seen or been aware of them had not a
cock began to crow which one of the soldiers had put on board at Cadiz,
being desirous of listening to the music of the cock; during two months
and a half, however, we had neither heard it nor known of its existence;
and the soldier was grieved at its silence. That morning, however, the
bird felt the land and began to crow, and its music woke all the people
on the vessel, who saw the rocks an arrow-flight off, and shouted to
let go the anchors, as we were drifting towards the rocks. And so they
lowered the anchors, and this saved us, for had not the cock crowed our
four hundred men and thirty horses would assuredly have been drowned;
and we all thought it a miracle of God for us. And while we navigated
more than one hundred leagues along the coast, the cock gave us his
music every night, and so the armada arrived at an harbour which
is called Cananea,[299] which lies beyond Cape Frio,[300] and is
twenty-four degrees of elevation. It is a good harbour, and there are
several islands at its entrance. The water is clear and eleven fathoms
deep. Here the governor took possession in the name of His Majesty, and
having done so, he left that harbour and passed over the river and
the bay called San Francisco,[301] which is twenty-five leagues from
Cananea, and thence the armada proceeded to the island of Santa
Catalina, which is twenty-five leagues from the Rio de San Francisco,
and they anchored at the island of Santa Catalina, after encountering
many troubles and reverses on the voyage, arriving there on the 29th of
March 1541. The island of Santa Catalina is barely in the twenty-eighth
degree of latitude.

  [299] Cananea, on the coast of the province San Paulo, Brazil, in lat.
  25° 1' S., long. 47° 51' W.

  [300] Cape Frio is east of Rio de Janeiro, in lat. 23° 1' S., long.
  41° 58' W., where the coast trends northward.

  [301] The river, island, and bay of San Francisco in the province of
  Santa Catharina.




CHAPTER THE THIRD.

    _Which treats of how the governor arrived with his armada at the
    island of Santa Catalina, in Brazil, and disembarked his troops
    there._


WHEN the governor had arrived with his army at the island of Santa
Catalina, he ordered the disembarkation of all the people that he had
brought with him, and the twenty-six horses, being all that had survived
the sea voyage of the forty-six taken on board in Spain, in order that
they might all recover on land from the hardships they had undergone in
their long sea voyage, and that he might take command and inform himself
of the native Indians of that land who might, perhaps, know how the
Spaniards whom he had come to succour were circumstanced in the province
of Rio de la Plata. And he gave the Indians to understand that he was
sent by His Majesty to bring help, and he took possession of the land in
the name and on behalf of His Majesty, and also of the harbour called
Cananea, which is on the coast of Brazil, in twenty-five degrees,
more or less. This harbour is fifty leagues from the island of Santa
Catalina, and during all the time that the governor remained in that
island he treated all the Indians, natives of that and other parts of
the coast of Brazil (vassals of His Majesty) with great kindness. By
these Indians he was informed that at fourteen leagues from the island,
at the place called Mbiaça[302] there were two Franciscan monks, named
Friar Bernardo, a native of Cordova, and Friar Alonzo Lebron, a native
of Gran Canaria; and in a few days these monks came to where the
governor and his people were, in great fear of the Indians, who sought
to kill them, because certain of the dwellings of the Indians having
been burned, these had in revenge killed two Christians living in that
land. And the governor, well informed of all that had happened, did
his best to appease the Indians, and gave refuge to the monks, and
established peace among them; and he charged the monks to teach the
Christian doctrine to the Indians of that land and island.

  [302] Mbiazá; cf. _supra_, pp. 35 and 83.




CHAPTER THE FOURTH.

    _How nine Christians came to the island._


AND the governor, in furtherance of his expedition to succour the
Spaniards, in the month of May 1541, sent a caravel with Philip de
Caceres, accountant of His Majesty, with orders to enter the river La
Plata, and visit the colony founded there by Don Pedro de Mendoza, and
called Buenos Ayres. And because the season of the year was winter, and
the weather unfavourable to navigation, he was unable to enter that
river, and returned to the island of San Catalina, where the governor
was.[303] And about this time there arrived nine Spanish Christians, who
came in a boat, having fled from the colony of Buenos Ayres because of
the ill-treatment used towards them by the captains residing in the
province; and from these Spaniards he obtained information of the state
in which the Spaniards were who lived in that country. They told him
that the colony of Buenos Ayres was inhabited and provided with people
and commodities; and how Juan de Ayolas, whom Don Pedro de Mendoza had
sent on an expedition of discovery into the interior, while returning
from his discovery, and intending to take refuge in certain brigantines
which he had left in the harbour, named by him Candelaria, in the river
Paraguai, had been killed by a certain nation of Indians living on the
same river, called Payaguás[304]; and all the Christians, with many
other Indians whom he had brought with him from the interior of the
country to carry the loads, belonging to the tribe of Chameses, were
also slain; and that of all the Christians and Indians only one boy of
the Chameses had escaped; and all this had happened because he (Juan de
Ayolas) had not found in the said harbour of Candelaria the brigantines
which he had left to be guarded till his return, according to the orders
he had given a certain Domingo de Irala of the province of Biscay in
Spain, whom he had left in the capacity of captain; who, before the
return of Juan de Ayolas, had withdrawn and abandoned the harbour of
Candelaria, so that Juan de Ayolas, not finding the brigantines as he
had expected, had fallen a victim to the Indians, who had stripped and
slain all his party because of the fault of the said Domingo de Irala,
the Biscayan captain of the brigantines. They also told him that on the
shore of the river Paraguai, one hundred and twenty leagues below the
harbour of Candelaria, a colony had been formed which was called the
town of Ascension,[305] having a good understanding and friendship with
a tribe of Indians called Carios, and that most of the Spaniards in that
province resided there. They further informed him that in the colony
and harbour of Buenos Ayres, situated on the rio del Parana, there were
seventy Christians, and the distance from that harbour to the city of
the Ascension, on the Paraguai, was three hundred and fifty leagues, of
very difficult navigation, up the river. Here, in the capacity of _locum
tenens_ of the governor of the land and province, resided Domingo de
Irala of Biscay, through whose fault happened the death of Juan de
Ayolas, and all the Christians whom he had brought with him. They also
told him that Domingo de Irala had gone from the town of the Ascension
up the river Paraguai with certain brigantines and people, saying that
he was going to search out and relieve Juan de Ayolas, and had entered a
land, much troubled with rains and marshes, and because of this he had
been unable to explore that land, and had returned with six Indian
captives of the same tribe of Payaguás as those who had killed Juan
de Ayolas and the Christians. From these prisoners he had obtained
information and sure knowledge of the death of Juan de Ayolas and of the
Christians, as well as from an Indian of the tribe of Chameses, named
Gonzalo, who had escaped when his tribesmen and the Christians, whose
loads they were carrying, were slain; who had lived ten years in
captivity among those Payaguás. And Domingo de Irala had withdrawn from
that country, having lost sixty men from sickness and fatigue. And they
also told him that the officials of His Majesty, residing in that land
and province, had done and were doing great wrongs to the Spaniards,
colonists and conquerors, and to the Indian natives, vassals of His
Majesty, and that there was much dissatisfaction and disgust. For this
reason, and also because of the ill-treatment they had suffered from
these captains, they had stolen a boat from the harbour of Buenos Ayres,
and had taken to flight with the intention and determination to inform
His Majesty of all that had passed in that land and province. To those
nine Christians, who came naked, the governor gave clothing, and took
them under his protection in order to bring them back with him to the
province, for they were useful men, good sailors, and one of them was
a pilot who knew the navigation of the river.

  [303] Schmidt gives a false account of this; cf. _supra_, p. 35.

  [304] Cf. _supra_, p. 27.

  [305] In the original Spanish version the city of Asuncion is always
  written _Ascension_.




CHAPTER THE FIFTH.

    _How the governor hastened his journey._


HAVING listened to the statement of those nine Christians, the governor
thought that, in order to succour as speedily as possible the Spaniards
residing in the town of the Ascension, as well as those in the port of
Buenos Ayres, he would discover a road by _terra firma_ from the
island, and so make his way to those parts already mentioned where the
Christians were, and that he would send the vessels round by sea
to Buenos Ayres. He therefore, against the will and opinion of the
accountant Philip de Caceres, and of the pilot Antonio Lopez, who
advised that they should all go together to Buenos Ayres, sent from the
island of St. Catalina, Pedro Dorantes (the factor) to explore a road by
land into the interior of the country where formerly many vassals of
the King of Portugal had been killed by the native Indians. This Pedro
Dorantes, by order of the governor, started with one hundred Spaniards,
and some Indians who acted as guides; and at the end of three months and
a half he returned to the island of St. Catalina, where the governor was
awaiting him, and this, among other things, was what he reported: having
crossed great sierras, and mountains, and much desert country, he had
arrived at a place called "el Campo" (the plain), where the country
began to be inhabited, and that the natives of the island had told him
that the route he had taken was the safest to enter that country. He had
followed a river called the Ytabucú,[306] which is opposite the point
of the island at eighteen or twenty leagues from the harbour. When the
governor knew of this, he sent immediately to reconnoitre the country
watered by this river, through which he decided to make his journey; and
having done this, he determined to enter the country by that route, in
order to explore a region that had never before been seen, and carry
relief, in the shortest possible time, to the Spaniards in that
province. Having thus decided upon his plans, he told the friars,
Bernardo de Armenta and Alonzo Lebron his companion, to remain in the
island of St. Catalina and instruct the native Indians in the Christian
doctrine, directing and confirming those already baptized. But these
monks declined to obey, assigning as a pretext that they wished to
accompany the governor, in order to establish themselves in the town of
the Ascension, where the Spaniards were whom he was going to relieve.

  [306] Or Itapucu. This river rises in the coast range, and falls into
  the ocean south of San Francisco.




CHAPTER THE SIXTH.

    _How the governor and his people advanced into the interior._


THE governor, having full information concerning those parts through
which he had to enter in order to discover the land and relieve the
Spaniards, and being supplied with all things necessary for his journey,
on the eighteenth of October of the same year ordered the embarkation of
the people that were to follow him in the discovery, with the twenty-six
horses and mares which had survived the sea voyage; and he ordered them
to cross the river Ytabucu and subdue it, and take possession of it in
the name of His Majesty, as newly discovered land. He left in the island
of St. Catalina one hundred and forty persons, who were to embark and
go by sea to the river La Plata, where the port of Buenos Ayres is
situated; and he charged Pedro Estopinan Cabeza de Vaca, whom he left
there in the capacity of captain of the said people, that before leaving
the island he should supply and furnish the vessel with provisions both
for the people he was taking with him, as well as for those in Buenos
Ayres; and before his departure he gave many presents to the natives of
the island, in order that they might remain, and some of them readily
offered their services to accompany the governor and his people, to show
the road and be useful in other ways; and their assistance happened to
be very handy. On the 2nd November of the said year the governor ordered
that all his people, besides the provisions carried by the Indians,
should each take what he could carry for the road. And the same day
he began his march, with two hundred and fifty arquebusiers and
crossbowmen, very well trained in arms, twenty-five horses, the two
Franciscan friars, and the Indians of the island; then he sent the
vessel back to the island of St. Catalina in order that Pedro de
Estopinan Cabeza de Vaca might embark and go with his people to Buenos
Ayres; and so the governor went on his way into the interior of the
land, where he and his people underwent many troubles. In nineteen days
they crossed great mountains, cutting roads through forests, to enable
the men and the horses to pass, for all the land was uninhabited. And at
the end of these nineteen days, having exhausted the provisions which
they had carried when they began their march, and having nothing left to
eat, it pleased God that, without the loss of a man, they discovered the
first inhabitants, who are called "del campo", where they found certain
villages of Indians, whose chief lord was called Aniriri, and at one
day's journey from this people there was another whose chief was
Cipoyay. And beyond this people again there was a third tribe of
Indians, whose chief said that he was called Tocanguasú. And when the
Indians knew of the arrival of the governor and his people, they went
out to meet him laden with plenty of provisions, showing great joy at
their arrival. The governor received them affably, and, besides paying
the value of the provisions into the hands of the chiefs, he graciously
gave them many shirts and other things, with which they remained
satisfied. This is a people and tribe called Guaranís; they are
cultivators, sowing maize twice in the year, and also cassava. They rear
fowls as in our Spain, and geese; keep many parrots in their houses,
and occupy much land, and the whole are of one language. They eat human
flesh, as well that of their Indian enemies as of Christians; they also
eat one another. This people is very fond of war, and they seek it; they
are very vindictive. Of this people and their territory the governor
took possession, in the name of His Majesty, as newly discovered land,
and called it the province of Vera,[307] as it appears from the deeds
of possession that were drafted before Juan de Aroaz, notary royal. And
this being done on the 29th of November, the governor and his people
left Tocanguasu. And after two days' march, on the 1st of December, they
arrived at a river called by the Indians Yguazu,[308] which means big
water; here the pilots took the depth.

  [307] Alvar Nunez took the name of his mother's family, 'Cabeza de
  Vaca'; the name of his father, a descendant of the Adelantado of the
  Canary Islands, was 'de Vera'.

  [308] The Iguazu, or Yguassu, a large affluent of the Paraná, rises in
  the Sierra do Mar, near the city of Curitiba, and flows nearly due
  west. It forms the boundary of the provinces of Paraná and Santa
  Catharina.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.

    _Which treats of what happened to the governor and his people in his
    journey, and of the nature of the land._


FROM this river Yguazu the governor and his people advanced on their
discovery; and on the 3rd of December they arrived at a river called by
the Indians Tibagi.[309] Its bed is paved with large stones, placed in
such order and regularity as though by hand. In crossing to the other
side of this river there was great trouble, because the people and the
horses slipped on the stones and could not keep their footing, and to
remedy this they joined hands. And although the river was not very
deep, the water ran with great force. At about two leagues beyond this
crossing the Indians came with great delight, and brought the army
provisions, so that they were never short of food, and had sometimes
even more than they could take, and left it on the road. This caused
the governor to give the Indians much, and to be generous with them,
especially with their chief, to whom, besides paying the price of the
commodities which they brought, he gave many presents, and did them many
favours and treated them so well that the fame went through the land and
the province, and all the natives laid aside their fear and came to see
and to bring all they had, and they were paid for it as aforesaid. The
same day, being near another Indian settlement, whose chief said he was
called Tapapirazú, there arrived a newly converted native Indian whose
name was Miguel, who came from the town of the Ascension, where the
Spaniards resided who were to be relieved. This Indian was returning to
the coast of Brazil, as he had been a long time with the Spaniards. The
governor conversed for some time with him, and informed himself of the
condition in which were the province, the Spaniards and the natives, and
of the great danger in which the Spaniards were because of the death of
Juan de Ayolas, and of other captains and people killed by the Indians.
Having given full information, this Indian, of his own wish, offered to
return in company with the governor to the town of the Ascension, whence
he had come, to guide and show the Spaniards the road they had to take.
Then the governor discharged the Indians that came with him from the
island of St. Catalina, and ordered them to return. These Indians, owing
to the good treatment and many presents they had received, returned well
satisfied and merry. As the people that the governor brought with him
were wanting in experience, and for fear lest they should do wrong or
mischief to the Indians, he ordered that they should neither traffic
nor communicate with them, nor visit their houses and villages, for the
Indians are of so easily excitable a nature, and shocked at the least
thing, that great inconvenience might have resulted in all the land. He
therefore ordered that only those persons who understood the Indians
should have dealings with them, and buy the provisions for all the
people at the governor's cost. And so every day he distributed the
provisions himself, and gave them gratis without any interest. It was
curious to see how feared were the horses by the Indians of that land
and province, that for the terror they had of them they dropped on
the road, and set food for them, such as fowls and honey, saying that,
provided they would not be angry, they would give them plenty to eat;
and to tranquillize them they said that they would not abandon their
settlements. But fearing lest the Christians should use violence with
them they fixed their camps at some distance off. Owing to the good
order that was kept, and seeing that the governor punished everyone who
offended them, all the Indians, with their wives and children, had such
confidence that it was a sight to see. And from very distant parts
they came, laden with provisions, only to see the Christians and their
horses, as a thing that had never before been seen in the land.

  [309] The Tibagi, an affluent of the Parana-panéma, rises not far from
  the Iguassu, and flows N.N.W. with a very rapid course and a total
  fall of 1,550 feet in 300 miles. Its characteristic rocks are trap and
  basalt. (See Bigg-Wither in _Journal R. G. S._, vol. xlvi.)

The governor and his people, continuing their journey through the
land and province, arrived at a settlement of Indians of the tribe of
Guaranís, and the chief of this tribe went out with all his people in
great joy to receive and welcome him. And they brought with them honey,
geese, fowls, flour, and maize. And the governor, through the medium of
interpreters, spoke to them affably, and told them he was pleased
at their coming, and ordered that they should be paid for what they
brought, which gave them great satisfaction. Moreover, he sent as a
present to the chief of this tribe, whose name was Pupebaie, some
presents, such as knives and scissors and other articles. We left the
Indians of this tribe so merry and pleased that they danced and sang
for joy all through the settlement.

On the seventh of December they arrived at a river known to the Indians
as the Taquari.[310] This river has a copious stream and a strong
current; and they found its banks inhabited by a tribe of Indians whose
chief was called Abangobi. This chief, in company with all the Indians
of his tribe, together with their wives and children, came out to
receive the governor, showing great joy at his arrival; and they brought
plenty of provisions, for which they were paid as usual. All these
Indians belong to one tribe, and all speak one language. From this place
they went on, leaving the natives so well satisfied that they carried
the news from place to place of the good treatment used towards them,
and showed everything they had received, so that wherever the governor
and his people had to pass, the natives were friendly and came to
meet them laden with provisions, receiving payment according to their
satisfaction. On the 14th December, having passed through some tribes of
Guaranís, by whom he was well received and entertained, the governor
and his people arrived at a settlement whose chief said he was called
Tocangusir. Here they halted one day to rest, because the people were
tired; and the direction they were following was west north-west a
quarter north. And at this place the pilots observed for latitude in
twenty-four and a half degrees, at a distance of one degree from the
tropic. Since entering the inhabited region they had found the country
to be very pleasant, with large plains, forests, and many rivers,
streams and rivulets, with abundance of good drinking water. In fact,
it is a land very suitable for cultivation and stock-rearing.

  [310] This river Taquari is a tributary of the Paraná-Pané, now called
  by the Brazilian geographers Paraná-panema. On this river Taquari the
  Jesuits founded one of their ancient missions of Guaira, under the
  tropic in the present Brazilian province _do Paraná_.




CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.

    _Of the troubles that the governor and his people underwent on their
    way, and of a kind of pine tree, and of the fruits of that land._


FROM the place called Tuguy, the governor and his people continued their
journey to the 19th December, without finding any settlements; this
circumstance, and the many rivers and bad passages that had to be
crossed by men and horses, caused them much trouble. They had to make
as many as eighteen bridges in a single day, across rivers as well as
over marshes, many of which were dangerous; and they had to pass great
sierras and steep mountains and large thickets of reeds that had hard,
sharp points, and other jungle. Twenty men had to be constantly in
advance, cutting and clearing a road; and it took many days to pass
through these forests, which were so thick that the sky could not be
seen overhead. And on the said nineteenth day of the said month they
arrived at a certain settlement of Guaranís, who with their chief, their
wives and children, showing great pleasure, came forth to meet the
Spaniards, two leagues from their settlement, bearing many commodities,
such as fowls, geese, honey, potatoes and other fruits, maize, and flour
of the pine tree, of which they make great quantity.

There are many pine trees in that land so great that four men with their
hands joined cannot compass one. They are tall and straight, and very
suitable for masts of ships and caracks, according to their length.
Their fruit is large, and the kernel about the size of an acorn. The
husk is like that of chesnuts, yet they differ in flavour from those of
Spain. The Indians gather them, and make of them a great quantity of
flour for their nourishment. There are many wild boar and monkeys in
that country, which feed on those kernels in the following way: the
monkeys climb to the tops of the pine trees, and suspend themselves by
their tails; then with hands and feet they detach a number of these
fruits and let them fall to the ground. And when they have thrown down a
quantity of these fruits they descend and eat them; but it often happens
that the wild beasts are watching while the monkeys pull down the fruit,
and when they have thrown them down, while the monkeys are descending
from the pine trees, the boars come out against them; and they steal
and eat the fruit, the monkeys all the while uttering cries from the
branches of the trees. There are also other fruits, of different kinds
and taste, that ripen twice a year. In this place of Tuguy the governor
remained during the feast of the nativity, both to celebrate this
feast as well as to rest the people. They found here an abundance of
provisions, for the Indians supplied them with all commodities. So the
Spaniards, partly owing to the festivities, and partly to the good
treatment they received from the Indians, were much refreshed, although
such repose was very prejudicial to them, because, taking no exercise
and eating plentifully, they could not digest what they ate, and
they immediately caught fevers, which did not happen while they were
marching. As soon as they resumed their march, after the first two days
they got rid of the disease, and regained their health. At first the
people importuned the governor, entreating that he might stop and
rest some days, but he would not consent to it, for he had already
experienced what would be the consequence; but the people thought that
he declined because he wished to give them more trouble, till at length
they were fain to acknowledge he had so acted for their good, since by
eating much they suffered; and of this the governor had great
experience.




CHAPTER THE NINTH.

    _How the governor and his people found themselves starving, and
    appeased their hunger with worms from reeds._


THE twenty-eighth day of December the governor and his people departed
from the village of Tuguy, where they left the Indians well pleased,
and, pursuing their route by land the whole day without finding any
inhabitants, they came to a wide and deep river with a strong current,
and along it were forests of cypress and cedar, and other trees; in
crossing this river they had plenty of trouble that and the three
following days. Marching through the land, they passed by five villages
of the Guaraní Indians, all of whom came forward and greeted us, with
their wives and children, bringing plenty of provisions, so that our
people were always well supplied, and the Indians very pacific, owing to
the good treatment and the payment they received. All this is a very
pleasant land, abounding in water and woods. The inhabitants sow maize,
cassava and other seeds, and three kinds of potatoes, white, yellow, and
reddish, very large and well flavoured. They rear geese and fowls, and
gather much honey from the hollows of the trees.

The first of January of the year A.D. 1542, the governor and his people
left the Indian settlements, and advanced across a mountainous region,
through dense thickets of reeds, where our people underwent much
trouble, because, up to the fifth of the month, they met with no
settlement, and had to suffer much from hunger; and they kept themselves
alive with great difficulty, besides having to open roads through
the reed jungle. In the hollows of these reeds there were some white
worms,[311] about the length and thickness of a finger; the people fried
these for food, obtaining sufficient fat from them to fry them in very
well; all ate of them, and thought it excellent food. And from the
hollows of other reeds they collected good drinking water, and were much
comforted by it. They used to search for these worms during their march,
in order that they might have enough to eat, and so provide for their
necessities and hunger in their journey through that inhospitable
region. They crossed, with great difficulty, two wide and very deep
rivers, flowing towards the north; and the following day, being the
sixth of January, after marching through uninhabited country, they
encamped for the night on the bank of another deep river, with a very
strong current and with plenty of reed thickets, where the people
gathered the worms and subsisted upon them. So they pursued their
journey, and the next day they passed through a very good region, well
watered and abounding in game, such as boar and deer, and they killed
some and divided it among the people. That day they crossed two small
rivers, and it pleased God that none of the Christians fell sick, and
everybody kept on marching in good condition, cheered by the hope that
they would soon reach the town of the Ascension, and the Spaniards whom
they were going to relieve. From the sixth to the tenth of January
they passed many Indian Guaraní settlements, all of whom received them
peacefully, and greeted them joyfully; the inhabitants of each village,
with their chief, accompanied by their wives and children, came laden
with provisions, from which the Spaniards derived great help. But the
monks Bernardo de Armenia and Alonzo his companion went in advance to
collect provisions; and when the governor and his people arrived, it
happened that the Indians had nothing more to give; and the people
complained to the governor of this, as they had oftentimes done before,
and he warned the monks not to do so, and not to take along with them
certain Indians, of all ages, who were of no use, and to whom they
gave food; but the monks declined to obey. Then all the people were
ill-disposed towards them; but the governor favoured them, as they were
engaged in the service of God and His Majesty. At length the monks
separated themselves from the people, and, against the will of the
governor, took another road. He directed that they should be brought
back from the Indian settlements, where they had taken refuge; and had
he not so ordered their withdrawal, they would have come to grief. The
tenth of January, continuing their march, they passed many rivers and
rivulets, and other bad passages, great sierras and mountains, and
thickets of reeds abounding with water; every sierra[312] having a
fertile valley and a river, besides other streams and forests. In all
this land there is plenty of water, because it is under the tropic, and
the direction of their route on these days was west.

  [311] The "reeds" of the text must certainly be bamboos, and the larva
  or grub found in them answers to that of the _Calandra palmarum_, a
  species of weevil which is still cooked and eaten in the way here
  described.

  [312] Sierra is a chain of mountains.




CHAPTER THE TENTH.

    _Of the fear the Indians had of the horses._


THE fourteenth of January, continuing their journey among settlements
of Indians of the nation of Guaranís, all of whom came to meet the
Spaniards with much pleasure, bringing maize, fowls, honey, and many
other commodities; and as the governor always paid them to their
contentment, they brought such a profusion that the surplus remained on
the road. All their people go naked, men as well as women; they had a
great fear of the horses, and asked the governor to tell the horses not
to be angry with them; and in order to appease them they brought
them food. So they arrived at a wide river of mighty waters called
Yguatú,[313] a very noble river, abounding in fish and bordered by
forests; on its shore there is a settlement of Guaranís, who sow maize
and cassava, as in other parts they had already passed through; and they
came out to receive the governor, being aware of his coming, and of
the good treatment they would receive; and they brought plenty of
provisions. In all that land there are pine trees of many different
kinds, with fruits like those I have spoken of. And the Indians waited
upon the governor and his people, because he always treated them well.
The Yguatú flows due west in the twenty-fifth degree, and may be as
large as the Guadalquivir. Its banks (according to the accounts of
the natives, and as I saw with my own eyes) are populous, and the
inhabitants are the richest people of all that land and province, both
for agriculture and stock-raising. They rear plenty of fowls, geese,
and other birds; and they have abundance of game, such as boar, deer,
_dantas_,[314] partridges, quails, and pheasants; and they have great
fisheries in this river. They grow plenty of maize, potatoes, cassava,
_mandubies_, and many other fruits; and from the trees they collect a
great quantity of honey. From this settlement the governor decided to
write to the officials of His Majesty, and to the captains and people
residing in the town of the Ascension, to let them know that by order
of His Majesty he was on the way to relieve them, and sent two native
Indians of that land with the letter. While staying on the river
Pequiry,[315] a dog bit a certain Francisco Orejon, citizen of Avila in
Spain, in the leg; and fourteen other Spaniards fell sick because of the
long journey. These remained with Orejon, in order to follow by short
stages. The governor recommended them to the natives, in order that
these might favour them, and guide them on the way to follow him when
they recovered their health. And in order that they might do this the
more willingly, he gave many presents to the chief and other natives,
who were much pleased with them. All this country, through which the
governor was marching with his people making his discoveries, is filled
with large fields abundantly watered by rivers, rivulets, and springs,
well shaded by trees and cultivated. It is the most fertile land in the
world, adapted for cultivation and colonization. Many parts of it are
conveniently situated for sugar refineries; and the country is full of
game. The inhabitants are of the nation of the Guaranís, who eat human
flesh, and are all agriculturists and rear geese and fowls. They are a
domesticated people, friendly towards the Christians, and with a little
trouble would accept our holy Catholic faith, as experience has proved.
And, judging from the nature of the soil, it is certain that if there
are mines of silver anywhere, it is here they may be found.

  [313] The Yguatú is an oriental affluent of the Paraná, entering this
  river at 25° lat. S. The name is not to be found in modern maps.

  [314] Anta or tapir.

  [315] The Pequiry flows into the Paraná ninety miles north of the
  Yguassu; the governor of Paraguai founded on its margin the town of
  Ciudad Real de Guaira in the sixteenth century, destroyed afterwards
  by the Paulistas.




CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.

    _How the governor navigated the river Yguazú, in canoes, and how, in
    order to avoid a cataract of that river, he carried the canoes one
    league by hand._


THE governor having left the Indians of the Pequiry very friendly and
peaceful, continued his journey with his people through the interior,
passing many settlements of Guaranís, all of whom came to meet him with
plenty of provisions, showing great joy at his coming. And to all their
chiefs he distributed presents, and even the old women and children came
to greet them, laden with maize and potatoes. And the inhabitants of
villages which were one and even two days off along his line of march
did the same, and all brought commodities; and for some distance before
the villages were reached they cleared and swept the road, dancing and
making great merriment on seeing the Spaniards. What increases their
pleasure and contentment is to see their old women merry, because they
are wont to do as these tell them, and are more obedient to them than to
the old men. The last day of January, continuing to advance into the
interior of the province, they arrived at the river Yguazú, and before
arriving at this river they traversed an uninhabited region without
finding any settlement of Indians. This is the same river they crossed
at the beginning of their journey, when they left the coast of Brazil.
It is also called in that part Yguazú. It flows from east to west, and
there are no settlements on its banks. Here they took the altitude and
found it to be twenty-five and a half degrees. Before arriving at the
river Yguazú, they learned from the natives that it fell into the
Paraná, also called Rio de la Plata; and that between this river Paraná
and the Yguazú the Indians killed the Portuguese whom Martin Alfonzo de
Sosa[316] had sent to discover that land, who were slaughtered while
crossing the river in canoes. Some of these Indians who had so killed
the Portuguese warned the governor that the Indians of the Pequiry river
were bad people and our enemies, and that they were lying in wait to
seize and kill us during our passage of the river. Because of this the
governor held a council, and decided to secure both banks of the river,
he with part of his people descending the Yguazú in canoes, and entering
the Paraná, while the remainder of the people with the horses went
by land, and took up a position on the bank in order to overawe the
Indians; all the people were then to pass to the other side in the
canoes, and this was accordingly effected. The governor himself with
eighty men embarked in canoes and descended the Yguazú, the remainder of
the people and the horses proceeded by land, as we have said, and all
joined on the river Paraná. The current of the Yguazú was so strong that
the canoes were carried furiously down the river, for near this spot
there is a considerable fall, and the noise made by the water leaping
down some high rocks into a chasm may be heard a great distance off, and
the spray rises two spears high and more above the fall.[317] It was
necessary, therefore, to take the canoes out of the water and carry
them by hand past the cataract for half a league with great labour.
Having left that bad passage behind, they launched their canoes and
continued their voyage down to the confluence of this river with the
Paraná. And it pleased God that the people and the horses that went by
land, as well as those in the canoes with the governor, all arrived at
one time. On the bank of the Paraná there had assembled a great number
of Indian Guaranís, all decked with parrots' feathers, painted red and a
variety of other colours, holding their bows and arrows and all massed
together for battle. The arrival of the governor and his people in the
manner we have described caused much fear among them and threw them
into confusion. We began to speak with them through interpreters and to
distribute a number of presents among their chiefs; and as they were
covetous people, delighting in novelties, they began to be appeased and
to approach us. And many of them helped us to cross to the opposite
bank.[318] When we had passed, the governor ordered rafts to be made by
lashing the canoes by twos together; and in two hours they were ready,
all the people and the horses reaching the other side without being
interfered with by the natives. This river Paraná, at the place where
we crossed it, was a long cross-bow shot wide, very deep and rapid; in
passing it one of the canoes upset and one Christian was drowned, the
current having drawn him under, and he never rose to the surface. The
strength of the current and great depth form many whirlpools.

  [316] Martim Affonzo de Sousa held a captaincy on the extreme southern
  part of the coast of Brazil, for the Portuguese Government, in 1531.
  This was the Capitania de Sao Vicente.

  [317] The Salto do Iguaçu, or fall of the Iguassu, is a succession
  of leaps made by this river at about eight miles from its mouth.
  The difference in level above and below the falls is 58 metres.

  [318] _I.e._, to the right bank of the Paraná.




CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.

    _Which treats of the rafts that were made to carry the sick._


WHEN the governor had passed the river Paraná he was greatly
disappointed at not finding the two brigantines which he had ordered by
letter the two captains who were at the Ascension to send, these vessels
being much needed to protect the passage for the transport of the sick
and those who were fatigued with the long journey. As there were many
incapable of marching who could not safely be left behind in the midst
of so many enemies, who might soon pluck up courage to attempt some
of their treasonable practices, he arranged to send the sick down the
Paraná on the rafts, entrusting them to the care of an Indian chief
named Yguaron, to whom he gave presents. This man offered to take charge
of the sick in person and bring them to the village of Francisco, a
servant of Gonzalo de Acosta, in the expectation that by the way they
would meet the brigantines, and would be received and entertained by
them; meanwhile this Indian, Francisco, who had been brought up among
Christians and who lived on the bank of the Paraná, four days' journey
from the point of their departure, according to the information of the
natives, would look after them. So the governor ordered them to embark,
and they were about thirty men, and he sent with them fifty arquebusiers
and crossbowmen for their protection. And as soon as he had sent them,
the governor, with the remainder of his people, continued his journey by
land towards the town of the Ascension, to reach which he would have
to travel nine days according to the information given by the Indians
inhabiting the banks of the Paraná. Possession was taken of this river
in the name of His Majesty, and the pilots took the altitude and found
it to be twenty-four degrees.[319]

  [319] This is an error. The mouth of the river Yguazú is in 25° 35'
  lat.

The governor and his people advanced across the country, passing
settlements of the Guaranís, all of whom received him well, and came
forth to meet him laden with provisions, as usual. In this march they
crossed large marshes, and other bad places, and rivers, and had to
build bridges and overcome many difficulties. After the passage of the
Paraná the Indians accompanied them from village to village, showing
great friendship and goodwill; they did them many good offices, both
in serving as guides, and providing them with food. For all this the
governor rewarded them generously, and made them well satisfied. During
the march a Spaniard came from the town of Ascension to meet the
governor, and took back tidings to his fellow-countrymen, and the people
there, of his arrival; for, owing to the straits they were in, their
desire to see him and his people was very great; and they could hardly
believe that he would do them such a service until they had seen him
with their own eyes, even though they had read the letters he had
written to them. This Christian informed the governor of the situation,
and of the danger the people were in, of the deaths that had happened
both of those who went with Juan de Ayolas, as well as many others
slain by the natives, and of their great tribulation and discouragement,
especially since the evacuation of Buenos Ayres; for they had long
expected relief from Spain, and when at length that port was abandoned,
they had given up all hope of deliverance. He also related many other
losses that had been sustained in the country.




CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.

    _How the governor arrived at the Ascension, where the Spaniards
    lived whom he had come to relieve._


HAVING learned of the above-mentioned Spaniard of the death of Juan de
Ayolas and his companions, and of the deaths of other Christians, of
the extremity of the survivors in the town of Ascension, and of the
abandonment of Buenos Ayres, whither he had left orders that the ship
_Capitana_ should proceed with the one hundred and forty men from the
island of St. Catalina; considering, too, the danger in which those
might be who arrived by sea, when they found that port deserted by the
Christians and in the hands of a large number of Indians, he made all
the haste he could to reach Ascension in the quickest time possible, in
order that he might infuse new courage into those who remained there,
and restore confidence among the friendly Indians. All the natives of
the parts he was now travelling through make their houses of straw and
wood, and many of those from the district round Ascension spoke to the
governor in our own Castilian tongue, bidding him and his Spaniards
welcome. Their reception of him was as cordial as any met with
heretofore. They cleared and swept the road, formed processions
with their wives and children, waited his arrival with presents of
provisions: maize, wine, bread, potatoes, fowls, fish, honey, and game,
all prepared; and they distributed these gifts among his men. In token
of peace they raised their hands, and, in their own language, some, too,
in ours, welcomed the governor and his people. Along the route they
entered into conversation with us, and were as cordial and familiar as
though they were our own countrymen, born and bred in Spain.

Travelling in this way, it pleased God that on the eleventh of March,
being one Saturday, at nine o'clock in the morning, in the year of grace
1542, we arrived at the city of Ascension, where we found the Spaniards
living whom we had come to relieve.

This town is situated on the bank of the Paraguay, in twenty-five
degrees south latitude. Before entering it the governor was met by all
the captains and people resident there, who showed incredible joy at his
arrival, declaring they had never believed, or even expected that they
would be relieved, so great were the dangers and difficulties of the
road never before explored; as for the sea-route _viâ_ Buenos Ayres, by
which they had hoped succour might have reached them, their expectations
from this quarter had also vanished since the Indians had taken the
aggressive with the idea of soon capturing and making an end of them.
Moreover, so long a time had elapsed since any Spaniards had landed
there, that they were in despair.

The governor received them all at an interview, spoke very kindly with
them, and informed them that he had come by His Majesty's orders to
succour them. Thereupon he showed his credentials and powers to Domingo
de Irala, and the officers Alonzo Cabrera, controller, a native of Loja;
Philip de Caceres, accountant, of Madrid; Pedro Dorantes, factor, of
Bejar, and to other captains and inhabitants of that province. These
documents were read out to the clergy and soldiers present, and by
virtue of them they recognized him as governor, and signified their
obedience as to a captain-general of the province, appointed by His
Majesty. The insignia of justice were given up to him, and were
redelivered, in the name of His Majesty, to the magistrates who should
administer civil and criminal law in the said province.




CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.

    _How the Spaniards, left behind through sickness, on the river
    Pequiry, arrived at the town of Ascension._


THIRTY days after the arrival of the governor at the town of Ascension,
as we have related, the Christians, both sick and sound, whom he had
sent on rafts from the river Paraná, arrived at the harbour, one only
being missing; and he had been killed by a tiger. They reported to the
governor how the Indians of the river assembled in great numbers with
their canoes, and while our men were descending on the rafts, came out
and attacked them with loud cries and beating of drums, shooting a
storm of arrows at them. Two hundred canoes surrounded them at one time,
trying to board and take possession of the rafts in order to kill the
Spaniards. For fourteen days and nights they never ceased fighting,
being exposed all that time to a constant fire of arrows, both from
those on shore as well as those in the canoes. The natives tried with
long hooks to seize hold of the rafts, and drag them towards the shore,
while the incessant shouting and cries of these men made so much din
that one would have said the powers of light and darkness were at war
with one another. They gave them no rest, for those in the canoes
changed places with those on shore, these continuing the fight while the
others rested. Twenty Spaniards were wounded, but not seriously; and all
this time the rafts kept drifting down stream, borne along by a strong
current. They descended so rapidly that rowing was unnecessary, and all
their efforts were directed to prevent their being drawn to land, where
the danger was greatest. Nevertheless, they were now and then exposed to
great peril, owing to the whirlpools which caught the rafts and twirled
them round; and it required all the skill of those that navigated them
to prevent them being taken inshore by the eddies. In this way they
continued their voyage for fourteen days without the possibility of
finding succour or protection, always pursued by the Indians in their
canoes, and a constant target for their arrows. At length they arrived
near the village of Francisco, the Indian, who, with some of his men,
came out to meet and succour the Christians. He brought them to an
island near his village, and gave them food, for they were weary
with the fatigues they had undergone, and starving. Here the wounded
recovered from their wounds, and all rested, for the enemy had not dared
to pursue them farther, and had withdrawn. Meanwhile the two brigantines
sent for their relief arrived at the village. In these they embarked and
arrived at the Ascension.




CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.

    _How the governor, wishing to re-people Buenos Ayres, sent
    reinforcements to those who had come there in the ship 'Capitana'._


ALVAR NUNEZ ordered two brigantines to be equipped with all diligence,
and to be loaded with provisions and other commodities; and having
manned them with some of the former colonists of Buenos Ayres who were
acquainted with the navigation of the Paraná, he sent them to relieve
the one hundred and forty Spaniards who were to have embarked at St.
Catalina in the ship _Capitana_ for Buenos Ayres; for, owing to the
abandonment of this port, these people would be exposed to great
danger. He ordered that the port should be immediately rebuilt in the
most convenient place, as the colony was necessary for the safety and
welfare of all the Spaniards in the province, as well for those who
might come there in future, ships being obliged to anchor in this part
of the river; here, too, brigantines have to be built to navigate the
river for three hundred and fifty leagues to the town of Ascension.

The first two brigantines set out on the sixteenth of April. After they
had started, the governor ordered two more to be built, and laden with
provisions and people, to proceed also to the relief of the Spaniards,
and to re-establish the port of Buenos Ayres. He gave special
injunctions to the captains of these two vessels to treat the natives of
the Paraná with kindness, and induce them by fair means to acknowledge
the sovereignty of the King. He, moreover, directed them to take note
of everything that occurred, in order that a full report might be sent
to His Majesty. Having made these dispositions, Alvar Nunez turned
his attention to the service of God, and His Majesty, and to the
pacification of the province. For the better accomplishment of these
duties, he summoned a meeting of the monks and clergy residing in that
province, as well as those that had come with him, and, in the presence
of all the officers, the captains and the people, he entreated them, in
kind but earnest words, to bestow special attention to the teaching of
the Christian doctrines to the natives, subject to the King, and he
caused certain passages of the Royal Charter to be read aloud, in which
special mention was made of the treatment of the Indians. He further
enjoined the monks, clergy, and other ecclesiastics, to take the Indians
under their particular care, and to protect them from ill-treatment, and
to inform him of anything done contrary to these orders--promising to
supply all things necessary for this holy cause, and for the celebration
of the sacraments in the churches and monasteries. And for this purpose
he supplied them with wine and flour, and distributed among them the
vestments he had brought for use in divine service; and he also gave
them a barrel of wine for this use.




CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH.

    _How the natives kill and eat their enemies._


SOON after the arrival of the governor at the Ascension the natives
and conquistadores brought serious charges against the officers of His
Majesty. Alvar Nunez therefore ordered all the native subjects of the
king to assemble, and in the presence of the monks and clergy told them
he had been sent to protect them, and that they should come to the
knowledge of God and accept Christianity at the hands of the monks
and clergy who had come as the ministers of God, and should subject
themselves to His Majesty. If they did this they would be better treated
and protected. He warned them to give up eating human flesh, as that was
a sin and grave offence in the sight of God. The monks and the clergy
repeated this warning, and the governor concluded by distributing
presents among them, such as shirts, stuffs, caps, and other things they
delighted in.

These Guaranís speak a language common to all the tribes of this
province. They eat the flesh of their enemies whom they take captive in
war, bringing them to their settlements and making great merriment and
rejoicing with them, dancing and singing till the captive grows fat.
They give him their wives and daughters, in order that he may have every
pleasure. It is these wives who take the trouble to fatten him. Those
held in the greatest honour among them admit him to their couches, adorn
him in various ways according to their custom, and bedeck him with
feathers and necklaces of white beads and stones, which are much prized
among them. When he begins to grow fat they redouble their efforts; the
dancing, singing, and pleasures of all kinds increase. Then the men
come; they adorn and make ready three boys of the age of six or seven,
placing a little hatchet in their hands. The Indian considered the
bravest among them now takes a wooden sword in his hand, called in their
language _macana_, and leads the captive to a place where he is made to
dance for one hour; the Indian then advances, and with both hands deals
him a blow in the loins, and another on the spine to knock him down. It
happens sometimes that after striking him six blows on the head they
cannot kill him, so hard are their heads, though this two-handed sword
is made of very tough, heavy, black wood, and the executioner is strong
enough to kill an ox with a single blow. When they have knocked him down
the three boys come with their hatchets, and the eldest of them, usually
the son of the chief, begins striking blows on his head, the others do
the same till the blood flows; the Indians meanwhile exhorting them to
be brave and learn to kill their enemies and make war upon them, and to
remember that this victim has killed many of their own people, and that
they should revenge themselves upon him. As soon as he is dead the one
that gave him the first blow takes the name of the dead man and keeps it
henceforward in token of his bravery. Then the old women cut the body
in pieces and cook it in their earthenware pots, distributing the flesh
among themselves. They eat it and consider it excellent food. Afterwards
they resume their dancing and pleasures, which last several days, saying
that now the enemy who had slain their relatives is dead, they will take
their rest and make merry.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.

    _Of the peace which the governor concluded with the Indian Agazes._


ON the banks of this river Paraguai there is a nation of Indians named
Agazes; it is a people most feared in all that country, for besides
being valiant they are well practised in war and very treacherous. Under
pretext of making a treaty of peace they ravaged other tribes, not
sparing even their own relatives, wishing to make themselves masters in
the land, so that nobody trusts them. They are men of great size and
gigantic limbs; they lead piratical lives in their canoes on the river,
landing to pillage and capture the Guaranís, who are their principal
enemies. They live by fishing and the chase, and do not cultivate the
soil. When they capture the Guaranís they tie their hands together and
drag them into the canoes and carry them away. Then they return to the
relatives of their captive, who come forth and offer to ransom him; and
they strike him cruel blows in the presence of his father, children, or
wives, as the case may be, and demand food, threatening to slaughter
their prisoner if this is not brought. Having taken as much provisions
as their canoes will hold, they return to their houses, carrying their
captive along with them. And this is their usual practice, for it rarely
happens that the captives are actually ransomed. After they are tired of
keeping them in their canoes and beating them, the Agazes cut off their
heads and hoist these on poles on the bank of the river. Before the
governor's arrival the Spaniards had made war against these Indians and
killed a number of them; peace had afterwards been concluded, but this
had been broken with characteristic perfidy by the Agazes, who had
done much injury to the Guaranís and carried off a quantity of their
provisions. A few days before the governor's arrival at the Ascension
the Agazes had violated the peace, having attacked and ravaged certain
villages of the Guaranís, besides keeping the town of Ascension daily on
the alert. When the Agazes knew of the governor's arrival, their chiefs,
named Abacoten, Tabor, and Alabos, accompanied by a large number of
their people, arrived in their canoes, and presented themselves before
him, saying they wished to swear allegiance to His Majesty, and to be
friendly with the Spaniards; they declared that if they had not kept the
peace hitherto, that was owing to the audacious conduct of some foolish
youths, who had begun hostilities without their leave, causing it to be
supposed that the chiefs had broken the peace, but that they had been
well punished for it; and they entreated the governor to receive them
into his amity, and make peace between them and the Spaniards, promising
they would keep it. This promise they repeated in the presence of the
monks, clergy, and officials. Having heard this message, the governor
received them kindly, and replied that he was pleased to receive them as
vassals of His Majesty, and as friends of the Christians, provided that
they would keep the peace, and not break it as heretofore. He gave them
to understand that, should they misbehave in future, they would be
regarded as enemies, and be made to suffer accordingly. In this way
he made peace between them and the Spaniards. He gave orders in the
meanwhile that they should be well treated and receive provisions. The
conditions of peace were that the said Indians, the chiefs of the Agazes
and others of that nation, should agree that whenever they descended the
Paraguai in canoes as far as the Ascension, they should not enter upon
territory belonging to the Guaranís otherwise than all together, and
never separately, nor by night, but always in the daytime; that they
should only land on the opposite side of the river, not on this side,
where the Guaranís and Spaniards have their fields and establishments;
that they should not ravage the country and harass the Guaranís, and
that they should terminate their war against them, and cease from
troubling them any more, as these people were now vassals of His
Majesty; that they should deliver up certain of their Guaraní captives,
of both sexes, who had been captured during the time of peace, because
they were Christians, and their relatives were much distressed at it;
that they should not interfere with the Spaniards and Guaranís when they
fished in the river and hunted on the land; and, lastly, that such
of their wives, daughters, and relatives who had been converted to
Christianity should be allowed to persevere in that holy work, and not
be carried away or compelled to absent themselves. Provided that these
conditions were kept, the Agazes would be treated as friends, but if any
article of the treaty were broken they would be proceeded against as
enemies. These terms having been well explained and understood by them,
they promised to observe them, and thus was peace restored and their
submission brought about.




CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH.

    _Of the complaints addressed to the governor by the pobladores
    against the officers of His Majesty._


A FEW days after his arrival at the Ascension, Alvar Nunez, having
seen that there were many poor and needy, supplied them with clothing,
shirts, trowsers, and other necessaries. Many of them that were unarmed
received arms; and all this at his expense, and without interest. He
then begged the officers of His Majesty to discontinue vexing and
wronging these unfortunate people, as they had hitherto done, for many
complaints had been made by both _conquistadores_ and _pobladores_. They
tried to enforce a new tax lately imposed on fisheries, butter, honey,
maize, and other commodities; on the skins with which they clothed
themselves, and which they bought of the Indians; and this besides the
collection of debts due to His Majesty. The officers urged the governor
to allow them to continue these taxes, but he would not consent to it,
and in this way incurred their animosity. Prompted by a bad spirit
towards him, they strove to do him all the harm they could by indirect
means. He therefore had them arrested and thrown into prison, in
consequence of evidence brought against them.




CHAPTER THE NINETEENTH.

    _How the governor received complaints against the Indian Guaycurús._


THE riparian chiefs, and those inhabiting the vicinity of the Paraguai,
near the town of the Ascension, vassals of His Majesty, came and
presented themselves before the governor, and complained of a tribe of
Indians that dwelt near their borders. These Indians are great warriors,
and valiant men, who live on venison, butter, honey, fish, and wild
boar, eating nothing besides, neither they nor their wives and children.
They go daily to the chase for it is their only occupation. They are
nimble and vigorous, swift of foot, and so long-winded that they tire
out the deer, and catch them with their hands, besides slaying many more
with their arrows, as well as tigers and other fierce animals. They are
kind to their wives, and not only to those of their own tribe, who are
greatly esteemed by them, but also to women generally; thus, if any fall
into their hands when they are making war, they set them at liberty, and
do them no wrong. They are much feared by all the other tribes. They
never remain more than two days in one place, but quickly remove their
houses, made of matting, to distances of one or two leagues when they
are in pursuit of game. This tribe, and others that live by fishing, eat
of a certain bean[320] that grows in that country; they search for it in
the mountains where the trees are that produce this fruit; and the wild
boar climb the hills at the same time, and for the same purpose. It
ripens in November and the beginning of December, and they make flour of
it, and wine strong enough to intoxicate themselves.

  [320] Algarroba, the Carob bean (_Prosopis dulcis mimosa_).




CHAPTER THE TWENTIETH.

    _How the governor informed himself concerning the complaint._


THE chiefs of the Indians complained to the governor that the Guaycurús
had dispossessed them of their land, and killed their fathers, brothers
and relatives, and since they were vassals of His Majesty, they claimed
protection and restitution of their property. They had hunted on the
mountains, they had fished in the lagoons and rivers, they had collected
honey for their own support and that of the Christians. Moreover,
the wrongs and murders they complained of had taken place since the
governor's arrival in the country. He examined into the complaints
of these chiefs, whose names were Pedro de Mendoza, Juan de Salazar,
Cupirati, Francisco Ruis Mayraru, Lorenzo Moquirasi, Gonzalo Mayraru,
and other newly converted Christians, in order to satisfy himself of the
truth of their allegations, and to proceed according to law; and he said
that they must bring good evidence of their alleged wrongs. They then
presented as witnesses a large number of Spanish Christians, who had
been present, and seen the injuries done by the Guaycurús; how these
people had driven them from their lands, and laid waste a large
stockaded settlement named Caguazú. Having heard this information, the
governor sent for the monks and clergy--friar Bernardo de Armenta, and
friar Alonzo Lebron, his companion; the bachelor Martin de Almenza, and
Francisco de Andrada, priests; and commanded them to inquire into the
affair, and report as to whether war could be justly made against the
Guaycurús. They wrote their opinion, and signed it with their names, to
the effect that he (the governor) might, with armed hand, march against
the said Indians, and wage war against them, since they were implacable
enemies. The governor then ordered two Spaniards, who knew their
language, and Martin de Almenza, with an escort of fifty Spaniards, to
go in search of the Guaycurús, and summon them to submit to His Majesty,
and desist from making war against the Guaranís, that these might freely
go about their land, and enjoy their chase and fisheries. If they would
do this, he promised to consider them as friends, but if they refused,
he should make war upon them as mortal enemies. So the ambassadors set
out, having been specially charged to repeat their message and warning
two or three times calmly and deliberately. Eight days afterwards they
returned, and declared that they had warned the Indians, but that these
had taken up arms against them, saying that they did not choose to obey,
or to be friends with the Spaniards and Guaranís, and told them to
withdraw immediately from the land. At the same time they shot a number
of arrows, and wounded many of them. The governor, having been informed
of all that had happened, ordered two hundred arquebusiers and
crossbowmen to be in readiness, and twelve horsemen, and with these he
left the town of Ascension on Thursday the twelfth of July 1542.

As he had to pass to the other side of the Paraguai, he bade them make
ready two brigantines, to ferry the men and horses across, and he
ordered all to assemble at a certain village of the Guaranís, called
Tapuá,[321] on the bank of the Paraguai. Its chief, Mormosen, is a brave
man, much feared in that country, who had already become a Christian,
and bore the name of Lorenzo. He had been master of Caguazú when the
Guaycurús took it. All the soldiers and the horses marched to Tapuá by
land, a distance of four leagues from the town of Ascension, passing, on
the way, large troops of the Guaranís, who had orders to rendezvous at
the same place, and accompany the governor on his expedition. It was
wonderful to see the order they kept, and their preparations for war,
all of them armed with bows and arrows, adorned with parrots' feathers,
and painted with divers colours. They had musical instruments, which
they use in battle, such as timbals and trumpets, cornets, etc. All
arrived on the same day at Tapuá, and found here large numbers of the
Guaranís, bivouacking under the trees along the river bank. The chief,
Mormosen, and his relatives, accompanied by a number of the people,
advanced to meet the governor, a bow-shot from the village, and brought
with them a large quantity of venison and ostrich-flesh which they had
killed on that and the previous day, in such plenty that there was
more than sufficient for all the people. The Indian chiefs then held a
council, and decided that it would be necessary to send out scouts to
reconnoitre the country and position of the enemy, and ascertain if
tidings had reached him of the advance of the Spaniards, and whether
he kept watch at night. This advice was followed, and two Spaniards,
together with Mormosen and other brave Indians who knew the country,
went forward. The following day being Friday, they returned before
nightfall, and reported that the Guaycurús had gone a-hunting in the
plains and mountains, having fired the grass in several places, as is
their wont. Our people had seen them moving their camp, accompanied by
their wives and children, to settle in a new place, where they might
subsist by hunting and fishing, and they seemed to be unaware of our
coming. From our camp to the place where the Indians had probably fixed
their abode might be five or six leagues, judging from the fires they
had kindled to drive the game.

  [321] _Tapuá_, as spelt in the original edition. In later ones the
  Gothic =T= has been taken for a =C=.--The Spaniards founded in this
  place a fort named Arecutacuá. See map of Oyarvide.




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST.

    _How the governor and his people crossed the river, and how two
    Christians were drowned._


THAT same Friday the brigantines arrived for the passage of the river,
and the Indians brought a number of their canoes. Being now fully
informed as to what should be done, and having taken counsel with his
captains, the governor arranged that the army should cross the following
morning, Saturday, and proceed in quest of the Guaycurús. He ordered
rafts to be made of the canoes, to convey the horses over, and as soon
as it was daylight the embarkation began in good order, the soldiers in
the brigantines, and the Indians in their canoes. The zeal displayed by
the Spaniards, and the loud cries of the Indians, were remarkable. From
six in the morning to two o'clock in the afternoon the crossing went on,
though there were two hundred canoes engaged in the passage.

A sad accident happened at this juncture. As the Spaniards vied with
one another who should be first, one of the vessels was overloaded and
capsized, the keel floating above water with all her living freight
clinging to it. They would certainly all have been drowned, had not a
number of Indians who saw the occurrence from the bank jumped at once
into the water and righted the vessel. But the current was so strong at
this place that two of the Spaniards were swept down the river, whom it
was impossible to rescue, their bodies being recovered lower down; and
their names were Diego de Ysla, a citizen of Malaga, and Juan de Valdez,
a citizen of Palencia.

When all the people and the horses had crossed to the other side, the
principal Indians came to the governor, and told him that it was their
invariable custom, whenever they were about to make war, to give their
captain a present, accordingly they begged him to accept it. The
governor, wishing to humour them consented. Then all the chiefs, one
after the other, brought him a prettily painted bow and arrow; and all
the Indians, one by one, presented a painted arrow adorned with parrots'
feathers; and the remainder of that day was taken up by the presentation
of these offerings, so that it was necessary to pass the night on the
bank of the river, stationing sentries to keep watch.




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND.

    _How the spies, by order of the governor, went in search of the
    Guaycurús._


ON Saturday, the governor, with the advice of his captains and monks,
arranged that before beginning the march, scouts should be sent in
advance to reconnoitre the movements of the Guaycurús, in order that
dispositions might be made to attack and drive them from the lands of
the Guaranís. So the Indian spies and Christians set forth, and returned
at four o'clock in the morning, with the report that the Indians had
been hunting the whole day, and that their wives and children were in
front of them, and that they did not appear to have any fixed idea of
settling anywhere. Upon this being known, it was decided to march at
once, as secretly as possible, in pursuit of the enemy, observing the
precaution of not lighting fires, and not breaking the ranks for the
purpose of hunting or any other motive, in order not to give the enemy
an inkling of their whereabouts. These dispositions having been taken,
they started in good order, on Sunday morning, and marched at the
foot of the forested slopes of the mountains, so as to conceal their
movements. The Indian scouts, all picked men and swift of foot, led
the advance, returning every now and again to report what they could
discover of the enemy.

The order of march was as follows: the Indians went together in a troop
extending over a league in length, all arrayed in parrots' feathers,
and with bows and arrows. In front of them was the advanced guard, and
behind came the main body, the governor and the cavalry, followed by the
Spanish infantry, arquebusiers and crossbowmen. After these came the
women, bearing the munitions and provisions of the Spaniards. The
Indians carried their own supplies. In this order they marched till
mid-day, when they rested under some large trees, where they all halted
and partook of some refreshment. After this, they resumed the march, led
by the Indian guides, along footpaths, where the quantity of deer and
ostriches was amazing. Neither Indians nor Spaniards, however, ventured
to hunt for fear of discovering themselves to the enemy; but all kept
their ranks, the Guaranís in advance numbering some ten thousand men,
all painted and bedizened with necklaces of beads and plumes, and plates
of copper, which glistened marvellously well in the sun. And many of
them had bows, and a great number of arrows.




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-THIRD.

    _How the governor, pursuing the enemy, was informed that he was
    marching in front._


THE governor and his people, marching in this order all day, there
happened, shortly after sunset, at the hour of Ave Maria,[322] a tumult
among the Indians. And a dispute arose in this wise. A spy came back
from the Guaycurús, and brought back word that they were retiring for
fear of the Guaranís, and that he had seen them hunting the whole day;
and that their wives and children were in advance, and he believed they
would settle that evening. The Guaranís had been informed, on the
other hand, by some female slaves, whom they had captured a few days
previously of another tribe called Merchireses, that the report current
among that tribe was that the Guaycurús were engaged in war with the
Guatatas, and were about to attack this tribe, and that was why they
were advancing with such haste through the country.

  [322] Answering to the Angelus in France, and to the Curfew in
  England.

The scouts continued to follow the enemy closely, in order to see
where he would halt, and give the governor information. And he, having
heard all this from the last spy, and seeing that it was a fine night,
ordered the march to be continued in the same order as before, a strict
watch being kept, the archers with their crossbows strung, and the
arquebusiers with their arquebuses loaded and fuses lighted, as the
occasion required, for although the Guaranís were marching with us and
were our allies, it was prudent to observe every precaution, and place
as little confidence in them as an enemy, for they are wont to be
treacherous if too much trusted.




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH.

    _Of a panic among the Spaniards and Indians, caused by a tiger._


THE governor and his army were marching through the skirts of a thick
forest, and night was approaching, when a tiger passed through the midst
of the Indians, causing a great panic and confusion among them, so that
the Spaniards took to their arms, and, thinking the Indians were in
revolt, fell upon them, calling on Santiago. In that affray several
Indians were wounded, and their companions, seeing the attack made upon
them, fled to the mountains. The governor himself narrowly escaped being
wounded by two gunshots, the bullets having grazed the skin of his face;
and these shots were certainly fired maliciously with intent to kill
him, and to please Domingo de Irala, whom he had deprived of the command
of the province.

Alvar Nunez, seeing the Indians had fled, and anxious to put an end
to the disorder, dismounted and rushed into the forest after them. He
called to them that it was nothing more than a tiger had caused the
confusion, that he and his Spaniards were their friends, and that they
were all brothers and subjects of His Majesty, and that all should
advance together and drive the enemy from the country. The Indians,
seeing the governor in person among them, and hearing all he said,
became appeased, and descended the hill with him. It is certain that
things were at one time so critical as to endanger our men, because, if
the Indians had fled and returned to their homes, they would never again
have had confidence in the Spaniards. The governor then summoned the
chiefs by name, and told them to follow him in perfect security, and
have no fear. "If the Spaniards were about to kill you," he added, "you
were yourselves to blame, for you took up arms, and made them believe
you intended to kill them; let it be clearly understood that the tiger
was the cause of this panic, and let us all be friends once more. You
know that the war we are about to engage in is in your interest and on
your behalf only, for the Guaycurús have never seen the Spaniards, or
had any trouble or grievance with them. We are proceeding against them
to protect and defend you."

Yielding to the governor's entreaties and encouraging words, the
Guaranís returned, and placed themselves under his orders, though still
frightened. They said they had been thrown into confusion by the fear
that the enemy was upon them, and had fled for protection into the midst
of the Spaniards, and this was the only cause of their fear. When the
chiefs were pacified, all the people came together, without anyone
having been killed. When all were re-united, the governor ordered that
henceforth the Indians should pass to the rear, and the Spaniards should
march in front, the cavalry being in advance of all, so that the Indians
might see with what goodwill the Spaniards marched against the enemy,
and lay aside any fears they might still have left; for the Spaniards
in that province depended entirely upon the Indians for their means of
subsistence, and without this would have had to abandon it altogether.
So they marched for two hours after sunset, and halted to sup under some
trees on the provisions they carried with them.




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH.

    _How the governor and his people overtook the enemy._


AT eleven o'clock at night, when the Indians and Spaniards were resting,
without light or fire for fear of betraying their presence to the
Guaycurús, one of the spies, who had been sent to observe the enemy's
movements, came into camp, and reported that he had seen them setting up
their village. The governor was much pleased on hearing this news, as he
had feared that they might have heard the reports of the firing that had
taken place in the confusion of the night. Having learned from this spy
that the spot they had fixed upon for their settlement was three leagues
off, he gave orders to strike the camp, and march slowly forward, in
order not to arrive at the place too early, so as to be ready to begin
the attack at daybreak. As a security to the friendly Indians, and to
distinguish them from the enemy, he ordered them all to paint white
crosses on their chests and shoulders, so that the Spaniards might
recognise them as friends, and not kill them by mistake for Guaycurús.
Although this precaution was adopted, it did not avail much in the
obscurity of night, when friend and foe became mixed up in hand to hand
fighting, and the quick blows of the sword could not be arrested.

We marched till break of day, and then reached the enemy's habitations,
waiting till daylight before delivering the attack. In order that
the horses might not, by their neighing, give the enemy warning, the
governor ordered their mouths to be filled with grass; meanwhile the
Indians were directed to surround the enemy's position, leaving a
passage for his escape to the mountains, so that the carnage might not
be too great.

While waiting in expectation, the Guaranís were almost paralysed with
fear; nothing would induce them to begin the attack, notwithstanding the
entreaties and persuasion of the governor. Soon after the drums of the
Guaycurús were heard beating to arms, and challenging anybody to come
and fight them, saying they were few in numbers, but more valiant than
any other tribe in the land; that they were masters of it, and of all
the animals contained in it; they were lords also of the rivers and the
fish. These people, who are accustomed to keep watch every night, a
little before daybreak came forward and threw themselves on the ground,
and in this position saw the host of our army, and the lighted fuses of
the arquebuses. And when they saw this they cried aloud, "Who are you
that dare come to our houses?" And a Christian who knew their language
answered: "I am Hector (this was his name) and I have come with my
people to barter (the corresponding word in their language meaning
revenge) the death of the Batates[323] whom you slaughtered." Then they
answered, "Cursed be your coming, for you shall be served as they were."
Having thus spoken, they threw the burning logs they held in their hands
at the Spaniards, and then rushed into their huts, seized their bows and
arrows, and attacked our people with such impetuosity and courage that
they appeared to make no account of them. The Indians who had come with
the governor showed great cowardice, and would have fled had they dared
to do so. Alvar Nunez, seeing this, entrusted the artillery to Don Diego
de Barba; Captain Salazar was placed in command of the Spanish infantry
and Indians, these latter being in two divisions. He ordered the
breastplates to be put on the horses, and, thus arrayed in order of
battle, our forces charged the enemy with cries of "_Santiago!_" The
governor, on horseback, led the van, and cut down all that opposed him.
When the enemy saw the horses for the first time, a great fear fell upon
them, and they fled to the mountains as quickly as they could. Passing
through their village, they set fire to their houses, and these being
made of mats of rush and grass, caught fire at once, the flames
spreading to the others, about twenty in number, all portable, and each
having a length of five hundred paces. Their owners, numbering about
four thousand warriors, retired behind the smoke caused by the burning
houses, and whilst so concealed killed two Christians, and decapitated
twelve of our friendly Indians. This operation is performed by the aid
of two or three teeth of a fish called the _palometa_, which bites
fish-hooks in two. These teeth are attached to a small stick. The
Guaycurús, holding their prisoners by the hair of the head, pass this
instrument round their neck, and with a twist or two of the head,
completely sever it from the body, and carry it off by the hair. They
will perform this operation while they are running, as if it were the
easiest thing possible.[324]

  [324] Cf. _supra_, p. 55.




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH.

    _How the governor pursued the enemy._


HAVING defeated the Guaycurús, the governor pursued them. As one of the
horsemen was following him, an Indian of the enemy seized hold of the
mare he was riding by the neck, and pierced her through and through with
three arrows he held in his hand; nor could they make him loose his hold
of the animal before they had killed him. If the governor had not been
present at this fight the victory would have been doubtful.

These Indians are very tall, swift of foot, valiant and strong. They are
Gentiles, having no fixed abode, and subsist by hunting and fishing. No
nation had ever conquered them before the Spaniards, and their idea is,
if anyone should vanquish them, to serve them as slaves. Their women are
allowed the right of delivering a prisoner who has fallen into their
hands, so that he shall neither be killed nor enslaved, and if he choose
to remain among them, he is treated as one of their own people. These
women have certainly more liberty than that bestowed on our women in
Spain by Queen Isabella, our Sovereign Lady. The governor and his
people, being tired of pursuing the enemy, returned to camp, and having
assembled his army, began his march towards Ascension, followed by the
Guaycurús a great distance, arms in hand; and the governor had much
trouble to keep his men together, and prevent them being cut down by
those of the enemy who had escaped in the fighting; for a Guaraní having
possessed himself of a feather, an arrow, or a mat of the enemy's, will
return home alone without taking the precaution of waiting for his
companions. In this way it happened that one thousand of the Guaranís
were caught and killed singly by about twenty Guaycurús. Four hundred
prisoners, men, women and children, were made in that expedition.

During the return march the horsemen speared a number of deer, and the
Indians were surprised to see the swiftness of the horses, which could
overtake the deer. They, too, killed very many with their arrows. At
four o'clock in the afternoon a halt was made under some large trees,
and they passed the night here, having stationed sentinels to keep a
good watch.




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SEVENTH.

    _How the governor and all his people returned to the town of
    Ascension._


THE following day, in broad daylight, they set out in good order,
hunting as they marched, and a number of deer and ostriches were killed.
Some of the former were even killed by the Spaniards with their swords,
as they fled from the horsemen and Indians and sought refuge in the
ranks of the infantry. It was a strange and very pleasant sight to see
the chase that day. One hour-and-a-half before nightfall they arrived on
the river Paraguai, where the governor had left the two brigantines and
the canoes. And that day they began passing the men and horses over to
the other side, and continued this the following day from morn till
midday, by which time all had been ferried across, and the governor and
his people marched on to the town of Ascension, where he had left a
garrison of two hundred and fifty men, under the orders of Gonzalo de
Mendoza. This captain had made prisoners six Indians of the tribe of
Yapirús,[325] who are tall and valiant men, good warriors and runners.
They neither cultivate the land nor rear animals, but live exclusively
by the chase and fishing; they are enemies of the Guaranís and
Guaycurús. Gonzalo de Mendoza informed the governor that these Indians
had arrived the previous day, having crossed the Paraguai; and had said
that their tribesmen had heard of the war waged against the Guaycurús,
and that they and all the other tribes were dismayed on hearing of this,
and that their chief had sent them to make it known that they wished to
be friendly with the Christians, and to offer their help, should it
be wanted, against the Guaycurús. Gonzalo de Mendoza had suspected
treachery in all this, and that their real object was to spy out the
place; he had therefore detained them prisoners till he could satisfy
himself of their sincerity of purpose. The governor ordered them to be
brought at once before him, and having sent for a Spanish interpreter
who knew their language, questioned them separately as to the objects
of their coming. Having seen that it would be to the advantage of His
Majesty's service, he treated them kindly, and gave them many presents
for them and their chief, promising he would receive them into his amity
as subjects of His Majesty, and would protect and defend them, provided
that they desisted from making war on the Guaranís, who were vassals of
His Majesty, and that this had been the cause of the war he had made
against the Guaycurús; then he dismissed them, well satisfied.

  [325] Cf. _supra_, pp. 54 _seqq._




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH.

    _How the Indian Agazes broke the peace._


GONZALO DE MENDOZA, besides what has been related in the previous
chapter, also told the governor that the tribe of Agazes with whom a
peace had been made, that very night on which he had started on his
campaign against the Guaycurús, had come armed to set fire to the town,
and make war upon the Spaniards. These Indians, however, had been seen
by the sentries, who had sounded the alarm. Perceiving that they were
discovered, they had then taken to flight, and made a raid upon the
cultivated land and establishments of the Spaniards, from whom they had
taken a number of Guaraní women newly converted to Christianity. Since
then they had come every night to maraud and pillage the land, causing
much injury to the natives, and had thus broken the peace. The women
of their own tribe, whom they had given as hostages for their good
behaviour, had that same night of their arrival escaped, and were
believed to have informed their people that the town was short of
defenders, and that now was the time to kill the Christians. Following
the advice of these women they had begun the war, and, as they are wont
to do, had laid waste the dwellings of the Spaniards, where they kept
their provisions, and had carried away upwards of thirty Guaraní women.
The governor caused an inquiry to be made into this, and convoked the
monks, clergy, officers and captains, whom he informed of the acts of
the Agazes, and how they had broken faith, ordering them in the name of
His Majesty to give their opinion in writing as to what they advised
should be done, and to sign it with their names. And all agreed to
follow this advice, whatever it might be. Then, having discussed and
considered the affair thoroughly, they were all of one accord, that war
should be made with fire and sword to punish the Agazes for the wrongs
and injuries they had committed, and were still committing, in the
country. This opinion was unanimous, and signed by all.

In order still further to establish the criminality of their acts,
Alvar Nunez ordered a judicial inquest to be held, and when this was
terminated he added it to four others previously entered against them
before his arrival. The Christians formerly resident in that country had
slain over one thousand of these Indians because of the losses they were
constantly inflicting upon them.




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH.

    _How the governor set at liberty one of the captive Guaycurús, and
    sent him to summon his fellow tribesmen._


HAVING proceeded against the Guaycurús as we have said, the governor
sent for the chiefs of the Guaranís who had marched against the
Guaycurús, and ordered them to bring before him all the prisoners they
had taken on that expedition, and that none should be concealed, under
a severe penalty. The Spaniards also brought theirs, and when all were
assembled, he told them His Majesty had ordered that none of those
Guaycurús should be enslaved, because all had not been done that ought
to have been done to ascertain their condition, and that His Majesty
would be rather pleased if these prisoners were given their liberty.
Among these captives was one of superior breeding and appearance, whom
the governor ordered to be set free, desiring him to summon all his
fellow tribesmen, because he had something to say to them in the name
of the king, and that if they wished he would protect them, and give
them presents, and so he let him go, giving him some presents; and he
departed, well satisfied, to his own people. Four days afterwards, he
returned accompanied by all his tribe, many of whom were badly wounded;
all came, leaving none behind.




CHAPTER THE THIRTIETH.

    _How the Guaycurús came and submitted to His Majesty._


FOUR days after the departure of the prisoner, one Monday morning, he
arrived on the bank of the river, accompanied by all his tribe; and they
halted by a wood on the bank of the Paraguai. When the governor was
informed of it he sent several canoes across with some Christians and
interpreters to bring them to the town. Twenty of the Guaycurús having
crossed in the canoes, came before the governor, and squatted on one
foot in his presence, as they are accustomed to do. They spoke through
an interpreter, and said as follows: "We are the chiefs of the
Guaycurús, and our forefathers have always been at war with all the
tribes of this land--Guaranís, Ymperus,[326] Agazes, Guatatas, Naperús,
Mayas, and many others, whom we have hitherto always vanquished, and
no people has ever conquered us, and we never thought we should be
conquered by anyone. Now we have found others more valiant than
ourselves, and we have come to place ourselves in their power and be
their slaves. You are the chief of the Spaniards, command us and we will
obey your orders. The Guaranís know full well that they are not strong
enough to make war on us; we fear them not. They would never have dared
to interfere with us without the aid of the Spaniards. Our wives and
children are on the opposite bank and are ready to make their submission
as we have done. We speak in our own name and on behalf of all our
tribe. We have come to offer our submission to the King of the
Spaniards."

  [326] Yapirús: cf. _supra_, p. 149.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST.

    _How the governor, after making peace with the Guaycurús, delivered
    the prisoners to them._


HAVING heard what the envoys of the Guaycurús had said, the governor,
seeing that so redoubtable a people had come to place themselves in
his power with so much submission (a thing that caused much surprise
throughout the land), desired them to be informed, through interpreters,
that he had come by order of His Majesty to bring all the people to the
knowledge of Our Lord, to be Christians and vassals of His Majesty, and
to be well treated; if they ceased making war upon the Guaranís he would
protect and regard them as friends, and would treat them better than
other nations, and that he would restore all the captives taken from
them without ransom, both those taken by the Spaniards and Guaranís.
And this was thereupon done. When the Guaycurús had received them,
they affirmed once more their wish to become vassals of His Majesty,
promising obedience and submission, and that they would henceforth not
molest the Guaranís, and that they would bring whatever they took, to
the town for the provisionment of the Spaniards. Alvar Nunez was much
pleased with their promises, and he distributed gifts and jewels among
the chiefs, and peace was cemented.

Since then they have always kept the peace, and whenever the governor
sent for them, hastened to obey his commands. Every eighth day they came
laden with venison and wild boar, roasted on _barbacoas_.[327] These
barbacoas are like gridirons, standing two palms high above the ground,
and made of light sticks. The flesh is cut into steaks and then laid
upon them and roasted. They also brought much fish and plenty of
other provisions, such as grease, linen mantles woven of a kind of
teasel,[328] dyed in bright colours; and skins of the tiger and tapir,
deer and other animals. When they came, the markets for the sale of all
these commodities lasted two days. The natives of the other side of the
river bartered with them; it was a very great market, and they (the
Guaycurús) behaved peacefully towards the Guaranís. These gave them, in
exchange for their commodities, maize, manioc, and mandubis; these last
are like hazel nuts or _chufas_, and grow near the ground[329]; they
also supplied them with bows and arrows. Two hundred canoes crossed the
river together for this market, laden with all these things; and it was
the finest thing in the world to see them cross. The celerity of their
movements is such that they sometimes collide with one another, and
all the merchandise falls into the water. Then the Indians to whom
this happens, and those awaiting them on the bank, burst into fits of
laughter, and the jokes and merriment continue all the time the market
is being held. They come to this market in full paint and in their
feathers, and all in this fine plumage are carried down the river, and
they vie one with the other who shall be the first across; and this is
the cause of their frequent collisions and upsets. In their marketing
they talk so loud and so much, that they cannot hear one another for the
noise, and all are very gay and jolly.

  [327] _Barbacoa_, i.e., _parrillas_.

  [328] There are several classes of teasel (_cardas_) in Paraguai. The
  fibres of one of them (the _caraguatá_) are used instead of hemp and
  thread.

  [329] Pea-nuts.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SECOND.

    _How the Apirús came and made a treaty of peace and submitted._


A FEW days after the departure of the six Apirús to return to their
tribe in accordance with the instructions of the governor, some of these
people arrived one Sunday morning on the bank of the river opposite
Ascension, and from the signs they made it was evident they wished to
cross. Thereupon Alvar Nunez sent canoes to the other side to find out
what people they were. As the canoes touched the opposite bank the
Indians entered them and came over to the city. On presenting themselves
to the governor they said they were of the tribe of Apirús, and having
seated themselves on one foot in token of their mission being a peaceful
one, they stated they were the chiefs of that tribe, and had come to
make acquaintance with the chief of the Christians and to be friends
with him, and obey his orders.

The expedition against the Guaycurús had been noised through the land,
and had caused much fear among all the tribes, inasmuch as these
Indians, the most valiant and redoubtable of all in that country, should
have been attacked and defeated by the Christians. In proof of the
peace and amity they (the Apirús) were desirous of maintaining with the
Christians, they had brought some of their daughters, and entreated the
governor to accept them as hostages and as proofs of their goodwill and
friendship. In the presence of the captains and clergy, the governor
replied that he wished them to understand that he had come to that
country in order that its people might be brought to the true Christian
faith and become the subjects of His Majesty; he enjoined them to make
peace with the Guaranís, who had become vassals of the king, and he
promised if they would keep the peace and live in friendship with all
the natives of that land, that he would favour and protect them, and
allow them to come whenever they wished to the city of Ascension to
barter with the Christians and Indians residing there, as the Guaycurús
had been allowed to do since peace had been made with them. To make sure
of their loyalty, and to please them by showing the value he set on
their friendship, he consented to receive as hostages the women and
girls they had brought, entrusting them to the care of the monks and
clergy, in order that they might be instructed in the doctrines of
Christianity, and be taught good manners and customs. To all this the
Indians assented, and showed much pleasure and satisfaction at becoming
the king's vassals. Since that time they have behaved obediently,
and shown a readiness to obey the governor's orders. The interview
terminated, the Yapirús received many presents, and took their departure
well satisfied. These Indians never remain in one place more than three
days, but are continually engaged in hunting and fishing in order to
provide subsistence for their wives and families. These habits of life,
and their want of a fixed abode, rendered it impossible for the clergy
to teach them the Christian religion, for the necessities of their lives
prevented them from abandoning their nomadic habits, dependent as they
were upon these for the means of procuring food; if, on the other hand,
they were to be compelled to give up this mode of livelihood, they might
die of hunger. Hence it would be lost labour to teach them, nor could
the monks live with them, owing to the insecurity of remaining among a
people so little to be trusted.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-THIRD.

    _Of the judgment passed on the Agazes by the advice of the monks,
    captains, and other officers of His Majesty._


HAVING received the submission of the aforesaid Indians, as related
in the previous chapter, Alvar Nunez desired to be shown the act of
accusation drawn up against the Agazes. Having seen this and the former
judgments entered against this people, it seemed to him that their guilt
had been clearly established for the robberies and murders committed
by them in the land. He then summoned the monks and the clergy, the
captains and officers, and showed them the act of accusation and the
instructions he had received from the king; and having well considered
it, they all unanimously advised that he should make war upon the Agazes
with fire and sword, for the service of God and His Majesty. In the
first place, however, thirteen or fourteen of these Indians, who had
been made prisoners, were condemned to death. The Alcalde Mayor,[330]
upon whom devolved the carrying out of this sentence, entering the
prison with certain others to fetch them out to be executed, was
suddenly attacked by them with knives, and might have been killed,
had not some persons hastened to succour him, and used their swords
to protect him. In the scuffle which ensued two of the prisoners were
slain with the sword, and the rest were taken out and hanged.

  [330] The Alcalde mayor was the mayor of the city.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FOURTH.

    _How the governor sent relief to Buenos Ayres._


PEACE and tranquillity being now established, the governor sent a party
to the relief of Buenos Ayres and Captain Juan Romero, who had been
previously despatched with two brigantines and some men with the same
purpose. For this new relief the governor decided on sending Captain
Gonzalo de Mendoza and two other brigantines with provisions and one
hundred men. These dispositions having been taken, he sent for the
monks, clergy, and officers, and spoke to them of the measures to be
adopted for the discovery of the province, especially with the object of
finding a route by land by which the Spaniards might be supplied with
provisions in passing through desolate uninhabited tracts, of which
there were many in that country. He charged them in His Majesty's name
to give this matter their serious consideration, and advise him in the
best way possible. The following are the names of the monks and clergy:
the commissary, Friar Bernardo de Armenta, Alonzo Lebron, a Franciscan,
Juan de Salazar, of the Order of Mercy, Luiz de Herrezuelo, of the Order
of St. Jerome, Francisco d'Andrada, the bachelor Martin d'Almenza, the
bachelor Martinez, and Juan Gabriel de Lezcano, clergymen and chaplains
of the city of Ascension. He also consulted the captains and officers of
His Majesty, and all these, having discussed the question fully, were of
opinion that he should with all convenient haste proceed to explore the
inhabited country through which the route might lie, into the interior
of the country, for the causes and reasons assigned by the governor. And
this was the order of the day.

That he might proceed on this discovery in the best way, and as promptly
as possible, Cabeza de Vaca sent for the principal Indians and the
elders of the Guaranís, and told them of his desire to seek out the
tribes in that province of whom they had often spoken to him; but before
doing so he wished to send some Christians to reconnoitre the route, and
since they (the Guaranís) were Christians and vassals of His Majesty, he
asked them kindly to furnish guides from their own people who knew the
country, that by doing so they would be rendering good service to the
king and advancing their own interests, besides receiving pay and
presents for their services. To this the Indian chiefs responded that
they would go and prepare the people, who would be ready to start
whenever they were required. Many of them offered on the spot to
accompany the Christians, foremost among these being Aracaré, a chief
of the upper river, and others whom we shall mention by-and-bye. The
goodwill of the Indians having thus been manifested, three Christians,
who knew the native languages and were experienced men, set out with
the Indians who had offered to undertake the discovery. The governor
recommended them to use the utmost diligence and fidelity in
reconnoitring the road. Meanwhile he ordered three brigantines to be
equipped with provisions and other necessaries. In these he sent ninety
Christians under the command of Captain Domingo de Irala of Biscay, with
orders to ascend the Paraguai as far as he could, and discover as much
as possible in the space of three months and a half; to take note
of what settlements of natives there were on the banks of the river,
collect every information, and report to him on the tribes and
inhabitants of that province. The three vessels, with their complement
of Christians, set off on November 20th, 1542. With them embarked the
three Spaniards and the Indians who were to reconnoitre in advance the
route by land from a port on the Paraguai, known as Las Piedras (the
rocks), seventy leagues above Ascension.

Eight days after the departure of the ships, Captain Vergara wrote that
the three Spaniards, together with 800 Indians, had set out from the
port of Las Piedras,[331] in the 24th degree, below the tropic, to
prosecute their journey by land, and that the Indians were in good
heart, and pleased to show the road. He further wrote that, having
recommended the three Spaniards to the care of the Indians, he had
resumed his navigation up the river for the purpose of exploring it.

  [331] Las Piedras, or Pan de Azúcar, is in 21° 25'.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIFTH.

    _How the three Spaniards and the Indians returned from their
    reconnaissance._


TWENTY days after the departure of the three Spaniards from the city of
Ascension to reconnoitre the road, they returned and said, that having
taken the chief Aracaré as their principal guide, they started from the
port of Las Piedras with 800 Indians, more or less, and marched for
about four days into the interior, following the guidance of Aracaré, a
man much feared and respected by the Indians. He had, however, ordered
all the fields where they passed to be set on fire, and this was a
signal to their enemies to come and attack them, besides being contrary
to the order usually observed in exploring a new country. Moreover,
Aracaré openly told the Indians to return, and not to show the country
to the Christians, who were evil, and he spoke in this fashion to them,
inciting them to rebel. They had begged the Indians to desist from
burning the fields, and entreated them to follow the road, but they
had refused; at the end of the fourth day the Indians had turned back,
having abandoned the Spaniards to their fate, who were in danger of
being lost in an unknown country, all the Indians and guides having
turned and fled.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SIXTH.

    _How wood was prepared for the construction of two brigantines and
    one caravel._


ABOUT this time the governor sent in search of timber in order to build
brigantines for the voyage of discovery he proposed making, and a
caravel to send to Spain, to report to His Majesty how things were
going in the province with reference to its discovery and conquest. The
governor went in person to the forests and plains with the officers,
the shipmasters, and sawyers, and within the space of three months
sufficient wood had been prepared for the construction of one caravel
and ten rowing vessels (_i.e._, brigantines) for the navigation and
exploration of the river. All this wood was transported by the natives
to Ascension, and the construction of the brigantines was at once
begun.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SEVENTH.

    _How the Indians came again and offered their services._


THOSE Christians who had been sent to discover a road by which they
might enter the province, having returned (as we have seen) without
bringing any report or information of what had to be done, and many
other natives having offered to assist the Spaniards in the discovery of
the country, the governor was pleased to speak with the principal among
them who came from the riparian districts and were newly converted
to Christianity, whose names were Juan de Salazar Cupirati, Lorenzo
Moquirasi, Timbuay, and Gonzalo Mayraru, besides others, and to accept
their services, offered with much alacrity and goodwill, promising them
in the name of His Majesty good pay and handsome reward. Four Spaniards,
who knew the country well, asked to be allowed to proceed on this
discovery with the Indians, promising to use every diligence in
this commission. Seeing this, and that they offered their services
spontaneously, the governor acceded to their request. Accordingly, these
four Spaniards, the Indian chiefs, and 1,500 other natives set out on
the 15th December 1542. Some ascended the river Paraguai in canoes,
while others went by land to Las Piedras, whence they were to make their
entrance into the interior. They were obliged to pass through the lands
and villages of Aracaré, but would not be turned from their purpose this
time by the words of this chief, and pursued their march in spite of
every attempt on his part to stop them. Their journey from Las Piedras
led for thirty days through a desolate region, where their sufferings
from hunger were very great. Some of the Indians died, while the
Spaniards were reduced to such straits from hunger and thirst that they
lost their way and did not know where to go. They therefore decided on
returning by the same way as they came, supporting themselves as well
as they could, on the wild thistle and other herbs. At the end of
forty-five days they returned to the city of Ascension. Aracaré coming
down the river, met them on the road and caused them much trouble,
showing himself in all this to be the deadly enemy of the Christians and
our friendly Indians. At length the Indians and Christians arrived
at Ascension, feeble and tired. The governor having learned of the
outrageous conduct of Aracaré, which had now become notorious, ordered
an act of accusation to be drawn up against him, and to be notified to
this chief--a somewhat dangerous commission, because Aracaré came out
with arms in his hands, followed by a number of friends and relations,
with the intent to kill the Spaniards sent to him. The process, however,
was duly served according to law, and Aracaré was sentenced to death and
executed,[332] the natives being made to understand the just cause for
which this had been done.

  [332] This appears to have been the chief Achkere, whose execution was
  entrusted to Domingo de Irala. Cf. Schmidt, _supra_, p. 37.

On the 20th December the four brigantines, sent by the governor to the
river Paraná to the relief of the Spaniards who had come by ship from
the island of St. Catherine, arrived at Ascension, together with the
ship's boat. In these five craft arrived all the people, who soon
disembarked. With them came Pedro de Estopinan Cabeza de Vaca, who had
been left in command of the vessel and the people.[333] He reported that
on arriving with his ship in the river Paraná he had gone straight to
Buenos Ayres, and at the entrance of that port, near the settlement,
he had found a ship's mast planted in the earth, with an inscription
carved on it as follows: "_Aquí esta una carta_" (Here is a letter). On
searching, this letter was found in a hole bored in the mast. It was
opened, and found to be signed by Alonzo Cabrera, surveyor of foundries,
and by Domingo de Irala of Biscay, who styled himself lieut.-governor of
the province. Its purport was, that Buenos Ayres had been abandoned, and
its inhabitants removed to the city of Ascension, for reasons set forth
in the letter. Pedro de Estopinan found the place in a state of revolt,
and his men ran imminent risk of death both from famine and war, for the
Guaranís attacked them incessantly. Twenty-five Spaniards, in order to
escape starvation, fled to the coast of Brazil to rejoin the ship, and
had not timely succour arrived all must have perished. As it was,
the day after the arrival of the relieving party, consisting of 150
Spaniards, the Indians attacked them before daybreak, set fire to their
camp, killing and wounding five or six Spaniards, and in spite of the
resistance from the men on shore, and those on the vessels, their lives
were in great jeopardy. He further reported that measures had been
promptly taken to re-establish the settlement and port of Buenos Ayres
on another site at the confluence of the Rio Paraná with the San Juan,
but this work had been much interfered with by the approach of winter,
and the floods, which made breaches in the walls as fast as they were
erected. They were consequently compelled to desist from their efforts
and bring all the people to Ascension.

  [333] Cf. _supra_, p. 106 _seq._

On the eve of All Saints, or on this day itself, some disaster always
happened to Gonzalo de Mendoza. On this particular occasion, while
navigating at the mouth of the river, one of his vessels was wrecked,
and a number of his men drowned. It happened in this wise: the vessels
were all at anchor, near the shore, under a high bank, his brigantine
being moored to a tree, when an earthquake took place. The shore was
thrust up, and fell into the river, bringing down with it the tree to
which the galley was moored. This struck the vessel such a tremendous
blow as to cause it to capsize and drift down stream, bottom upwards,
for half a league. Fourteen persons, men and women, were drowned on
this and the other vessels. According to the report of those who were
present, such a terrific thing had never before occurred. After these
experiences they arrived at Ascension, and were all comfortably lodged
and provided with necessaries. The governor, with all his people,
returned thanks to God for His mercy in having brought them into safety,
and saved them from so many dangers.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-EIGHTH.

    _How the settlement of Ascension was burned._


ON the 4th February of the following year, 1543, one Sunday morning,
three hours before daybreak, a straw house in the city of Ascension
took fire, and the flames spread so rapidly that in a short time the
conflagration was awful to see. The Spaniards were greatly dismayed,
thinking it was the work of Indian incendiaries, who wished to drive
them from the country. In this emergency the governor caused the alarm
to be sounded, and all hurriedly took up arms and repaired to their
several stations, to be ready to defend their lives and the place. Owing
to these measures, the Spaniards escaped with their lives, but their
property was all destroyed. Upwards of 200 houses were burnt down, only
fifty being saved, these being separated from the rest by a stream of
water which ran between them. Upwards of 5,000 measures of maize were
burnt in grain, this being the staple production of the country. A
quantity of maize-flour, and other provisions, such as poultry and
pigs, were destroyed, and the Spaniards were reduced to such a state of
destitution that they had no clothes to wear. The fire continued for
four days, burning everything above and below ground, even to the walls
of the town and fortress. It was ascertained that the fire originated
with an Indian woman living with a Christian, who was shaking a burning
hammock, when a spark fell on the wall of the house; this being of
straw, instantly ignited, and burst into flames. The governor, seeing
the miserable condition of the Spaniards, whose houses and property had
been destroyed, supplied them with his own things, giving food to those
who had none. In this way he promptly relieved their necessities, and
caused the houses to be rebuilt of less inflammable materials, using
for this purpose clay (_tapia_). In a few days, such was the energy
displayed, the rebuilding was completed.




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-NINTH.

    _How Domingo de Irala arrived._


ON the 15th February Domingo de Irala, returning from his exploration of
the Paraguai, moored his three brigantines in the port of Ascension, and
landed to make his report to the governor. He said that from the 20th
October, when he departed from Ascension, to the 6th January, the
festival of the Three Kings, he was constantly navigating the river
Paraguai, holding intercourse with the natives along the banks, and
noting down the information they gave him. On that day he arrived at a
settlement of Indians, who cultivate the soil and rear fowls and geese:
the latter as a protection against crickets, which do them much damage,
for these insects gnaw and eat their mantles, and breed in the straw of
which their houses are built. In order to preserve their garments they
keep them and their furs in large earthenware jars, covered with clay
lids. In this way they protect their wardrobe. When the crickets fall
from the roofs of the houses in large numbers the geese devour them
eagerly, and this happens two or three times a day, and is a sight worth
seeing. These Indians dwell in the midst of lagoons, and are called
_Cacocies Chaneses_.[334] They told Domingo de Irala that the way into
the interior of the country lay through their territory; he travelled
for three days by it, and it seemed to him a good land; they had
also given him an idea of the regions beyond. There, as he learned,
provisions were abundant enough to supply a party of explorers who might
enter and take possession of the country. These Indians had shown him
specimens of their gold and silver, and had offered to guide him. During
the whole of his voyage he did not see a more convenient or better
country by which to penetrate into the interior, and he had named the
port where he landed, in honour of the day of his arrival, _Puerto de
los Reyes_ (Port of the Kings[335]). The inhabitants having expressed a
great desire to see the Spaniards, he entreated the governor to go and
make their acquaintance.

  [334] These Indians are the Xarayos.

  [335] This port was situated in 18° latitude.

When Domingo de Irala had made his report concerning all that he had
seen and learned, Cabeza de Vaca commanded the monks and the clergy, the
officers and the captains, to assemble, and caused to be read to them
the report brought by Domingo de Irala. He begged them to give him their
opinion and advice as to what should be done for the discovery of this
country in the service of God and His Majesty, seeing that now the best
and most certain route hitherto known into the interior had been found.
And all the assembly agreed that it was expedient for the service of God
and His Majesty that an entrance into the country should be made from
the port of Los Reyes, and their opinion was reduced into writing and
signed with their names. They were also of opinion that the discovery
should be made without delay, as provisions and other necessaries were
to be found there in abundance.

Having seen and approved of the opinion of the monks, the clergy, and
the captains, the governor gave orders to equip and make ready the ten
brigantines which had been built for the service of His Majesty. He bade
the Guaranís supply provisions for the voyage, the fire having destroyed
the stores of the Spaniards, and he expended on these preparations
his own resources, paying the Indians for the provisions they brought,
besides giving them many presents. This he did so as not to delay
matters till the next harvest. In order that everything might be
prepared with the utmost speed, he sent Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza with
three brigantines up the river Paraguai to the lands and villages of the
friendly Indians, vassals of His Majesty, to load these vessels there,
ordering him to pay for everything, and treat the natives in a kindly
way, satisfying them with presents, of which he took a large number,
and he charged him to keep a watch and see that the interpreters dealt
fairly by the Indians, abstaining from doing them any wrong or
compulsion, under threat of punishment. Those were his orders.




CHAPTER THE FORTIETH.

    _What Gonzalo de Mendoza wrote._


A FEW days after Gonzalo de Mendoza had set out with the three
brigantines he wrote and informed the governor of his arrival at the
port of Giguy,[336] and of his having sent into the interior to those
villages where provisions were obtainable, and that many Indian chiefs
had been to visit him, and had begun bringing in provisions; that
the interpreters had fled from the natives and taken refuge in the
brigantines, because an attempt to kill them had been made by the
friends and relatives of an Indian who was in revolt and was raising the
country against the Christians and against our Indian allies, advising
them not to give us provisions, and that many Indian chiefs had come to
beg for assistance and help to protect their tribes against two chiefs
named Guaçani and Atabare,[337] who with all their relatives and friends
were making war upon them with fire and sword, burning their settlements
and ravaging their lands, threatening to kill them and destroy them
utterly if they would not unite to drive out the Christians. He (Gonzalo
de Mendoza) was temporising and parleying with these people till he knew
what measures it would be expedient to adopt, and meanwhile the Indians
had brought no provisions, because the enemy had blocked the roads, and
his Spaniards were starving.

  [336] This river is the Jejuy.

  [337] Tabaré; cf. _supra_, p. 38.

Having read Gonzalo de Mendoza's letter, the governor assembled the
monks, clergy, officers, and captains, and caused it to be read to
them. He then asked them to give their opinion as to what they thought
expedient to be done in that emergency, having regard to the king's
instructions, which were also read to them; and they answered, that
since the Indians were making war against the Christians and His
Majesty's vassals, their opinion was (and it was recorded in writing and
signed with their names) that he should march against them, and, after
demanding peace, should exhort them to give in their submission; failing
which, and after repeating his request twice, thrice, or as often as was
deemed necessary, and warning them that they would be held responsible
for any evil consequences that might ensue, that then war should be
waged against them as enemies, for the defence and protection of the
friendly natives.

A few days after the above occurrences, the said Captain Gonzalo de
Mendoza wrote again to the governor, informing him how the Indian
chiefs Guaçani and Atabare were making a cruel war against the friendly
natives, over-running their land, slaying and robbing them, as far as
the port where the Christians were collecting provisions, and that the
Indian allies were much harassed, and were daily beseeching him (Gonzalo
de Mendoza) for aid, and saying that if he did not soon help them, all
the Indians would rise in revolt, reminding him, too, of the cruel
losses such a war entailed upon them.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-FIRST.

    _How the governor helped those who were with Gonzalo de Mendoza._


AFTER reading this letter, and becoming aware of the complaints made by
the natives, Alvar Nunez summoned another council of monks, clergy, and
officers, and, in pursuance of their advice, commissioned Domingo de
Irala to take measures to protect the Indian allies, and put an end to
the war that had broken out, aiding in every way those natives who had
sustained losses at the hands of the enemy. To this effect he sent four
brigantines with 150 men besides those who had already gone under the
command of Gonzalo de Mendoza, and ordered Domingo de Irala to proceed
at once to the ports and villages of Guaçani and Atabare, and summon
them, in the name of His Majesty, to desist from the war and to return
to their homes, and live henceforward in peace and amity with the
Spaniards. Should these chiefs refuse to listen to these proposals,
which were to be repeated as often as possible, that he was then to make
war upon them, doing them, however, as little injury as he could, and
avoiding murders, robberies, and other evils. He was to compel them to
make peace and enter into friendly relations with our Indian allies, for
while this fighting was going on there could be no peace in the country,
and the service of His Majesty would not be advanced. The governor also
sent presents for distribution among those who were inclined to come to
terms.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-SECOND.

    _How four Christians died of their wounds during this war._


WHEN Domingo de Irala arrived at the village of the Indians he sent to
summon Atabare and Guaçani, the principal instigators of the war. These
chiefs had a large number of people with them who were prepared for
fighting, and would not listen to the interpreters when they summoned
them to make peace. They even defied the friendly Indians, robbed and
caused them much injury. While protecting our allies, a number of
skirmishes took place, and some Christians were wounded. They were sent
to Ascension to be healed, but four or five died of their wounds. It was
their own fault, and the consequence of the excesses they committed, for
the wounds were light, and would not have caused death. One of them
died miserably from a scratch of an arrow on his nose. These arrows
are rubbed with poisonous herbs, and when those wounded by them commit
excesses with women, they die. In general, however, the herbs of this
country are not dangerous.

The governor wrote again to Domingo de Irala, urging him to renew
friendly relations with the Indians by every means in his power, because
it was advantageous for His Majesty's service. Indeed, as long as
the country was disturbed by war, surprises, revolts, murders, and
robberies, troubles would never cease. By bringing about a peace, he
wrote, they would be doing their duty towards God and the king. At the
same time he sent a quantity of provisions for gratuitous distribution
among the Indians who had served, adding all that he could think of to
strengthen peace and concord.

Under these circumstances Domingo de Irala proceeded to make peace. He
found the enemy much harassed and fatigued by the war they had been
carrying on with the Spaniards, and desirous of putting an end to it.
They were disposed to come to terms with our Indian allies and renew
their allegiance to the king. Finally, Guaçani and Atabare, and many
other chiefs and people, accepted the conditions offered them, and
came before the governor to ratify the peace. He told them that in
discontinuing hostilities they had done their duty, that he forgave them
their past disobedience, and that if they rebelled again they would be
punished without mercy. After this he gave them presents, and dismissed
them very happy and contented. Seeing now that the country was at peace,
and the natives living in concord, the governor ordered them to hasten
bringing in the provisions and other necessaries, in order to equip ten
vessels he was preparing for the discovery of the country by the port of
Los Reyes, in accordance with the resolution come to. In a few days the
natives brought over 3,000 quintals of manioc flour and maize, and with
these he completed loading the ships, paying for everything to the
satisfaction of the Indians. He also furnished the Spaniards with arms
and other necessaries.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-THIRD.

    _How the friars took to flight._


NOW when the brigantines were on the point of sailing, and everything
was ready for the voyage of exploration as recommended by the council,
the friars Bernaldo de Armenta and Alonso Lebron his companion, were
silently and secretly induced to proceed to the coast of Brazil by the
route explored by the governor, bearing certain letters for His Majesty,
acquainting him with the bad use the governor was making of the powers
and authority graciously conferred upon him. This was done out of
jealousy and hatred towards the governor, and in order to hinder his
exploration and discovery of the country, so that his service to
the king might be of no effect. The motive of their conduct was as
follows: When he arrived in that country the governor found everything
disorganised, the Christians in poor circumstances and without arms,
and the inhabitants complaining of the extortionate behaviour of the
officers, who, to advance their personal interests, had most unjustly
levied tribute and a new tax, contrary to the custom of Spain and the
Indies, to which they gave the name of _quinto_, as we have already
stated in the course of this narrative. But Alvar Nunez not suffering
them to continue these exactions, they opposed his discovery, and it was
on this account that the monks were induced by them to depart. These
friars caused the people to swear on the crucifix that they would not
divulge their departure for Brazil. But when the Indian chiefs had
notice of it they came before the governor, and demanded the restitution
of their daughters, whom they had given up to the monks to be taught
the Christian religion, as it had reached their ears that the monks were
intending to go to the coast of Brazil and carry their daughters along
with them; and as they understood that all those who went thither never
returned alive, and that the girls did not wish to go, and would have
run away were it not that the friars kept them in custody. When the
governor heard this the monks had already set out on their journey, so
he sent after them, and they were overtaken two leagues from the city
and obliged to return. The girls they were carrying off were thirty-five
in number, besides other Christian converts, all of whom were brought
back. This caused a great tumult among the people, as well Spaniards as
Indians, and great complaint was made by the Indians at the abduction of
their daughters. They also brought before the governor an Indian named
Domingo from the coast of Brazil, a person of great importance in His
Majesty's service. Then Cabeza de Vaca ordered the depositions against
the monks and officers to be taken, and proceedings were begun against
them for the crime they had committed against His Majesty. In order that
he might not be detained in his voyage of exploration, he deputed the
cause to a judge, and bade him investigate the whole matter as to the
misdeeds of the accused persons and the charges brought against them.
Two of them he took with him on bail, leaving the others in prison in
the city, suspended from office till such time as His Majesty should
ordain as to what should further be done in the matter.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-FOURTH.

    _How the governor took four hundred men with him on his voyage of
    discovery._


ALL preparations being now completed for the voyage of discovery, and
the ten brigantines having been laden with provisions, the governor
selected 400 arquebusiers and archers to accompany him on that journey.
Half of these embarked on the brigantines, the others, together with
twelve horsemen, went by land along the river bank as far as the port
of Guayviano, keeping constantly among settlements of the friendly
Guaranís, this being the best route. The horses were taken on the
vessels, but in order that they should not consume the provisions on
board, and might feed themselves on shore, they were sent eight days
beforehand. The factor, Pedro Dorantes, and the accountant, Philip de
Caceres, went with them. Eight days afterwards the governor embarked,
having left as his lieutenant Juan de Salazar de Espinosa, whom he
charged to administer the province, and govern peacefully and justly
in the name of the king. Two hundred soldiers--arquebusiers and
archers--and six horsemen remained behind to protect and defend the
city. On the day of Our Lady of September,[338] the church upon which
Cabeza de Vaca had himself worked ever since its destruction by fire was
handsomely finished. He set out from Ascension with twenty brigantines
and 120 canoes. In these were 1,200 Indian warriors, whose strange
appearance, armed with bows and arrows, produced a wonderful effect, in
their war paint adorned with plumes and feathers, and wearing on their
brows plates of metal, so that when the sun shone they glittered
marvellously. The Indians said they wore these plates in order that they
might so glitter and dazzle the eyes of the enemy; and they went forth
with loud cries and shouts, all as merry as possible. When the governor
departed from the city he left word with Captain Salazar to use every
effort to complete the caravel, which he had ordered to be built, and
make it ready against his return, so that he might then send his report
to Spain of all that had happened in his voyage of exploration. Having
made all the necessary dispositions, and the weather being favourable,
he reached the port of Tapua,[339] where he was received by the chiefs.
These he told that he was about to undertake a voyage of discovery of
that land; he therefore begged them always to live in peace and concord
with their neighbours. If they obeyed him they would always be as
well, and better, treated than heretofore, and he gave presents to be
distributed among them, their sons and relatives, and left them well
pleased and satisfied.

  [338] This is the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, on the
  8th of September.

  [339] Cf. _supra_, p. 137.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-FIFTH.

    _How the governor left part of the provisions he had brought with
    him._


BECAUSE the vessels were so heavily laden with provisions that they
could not safely carry them, the governor left in Tapuá more than 200
quintals, and then sailed further, and after a prosperous voyage arrived
at the port called by the Indians _Inriquizava_,[340] arriving there at
one o'clock in the night. Here he remained three days in order to open
intercourse with the natives, who came to see him in large numbers,
bringing provisions, which were distributed among the Spaniards, as well
as among the friendly Guaranís. All these people were received with
kindness by the governor, because they had always been our good friends.
He gave presents to the chiefs, told them he was about to discover the
country, which would be a good and profitable thing for all of them, and
meanwhile he begged them to keep peace with the Spaniards that remained
in the city of Ascension. This they promised him they would do, and so
having left them well pleased and satisfied, he proceeded on his voyage
up the river.

  [340] Yeruquihaba. Cf. _supra_, p. 58.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-SIXTH.

    _How he stopped to speak with the natives of another port and land._


ON the 12th of that month he reached another port, called _Itaqui_,
where he moored his brigantines, in order to hold intercourse with the
natives, who are Guaranís and vassals of the king. That day a large
number of Indians, accompanied by their chiefs, came laden with
provisions, whom the governor informed, as he had done the others, of
his intended voyage of exploration. These also he exhorted to keep peace
with the Spanish Christians at Ascension, and besides paying them for
the provisions they brought, he distributed presents among the chiefs
and their relatives, leaving them well satisfied. He stayed here two
days and then sailed farther, passing by a second port, Itaqui, and
afterwards moored at the port of Guaçani--the chief who revolted with
Atabare in the war I have spoken of, but who was now living in peace and
amity with the Spaniards and their allies. As soon as these chiefs knew
of the arrival of the governor they made haste to come and see him, whom
he received very lovingly, because they had kept the peace, and all
their people were joyous and confident because these chiefs, their
masters, having entered into friendly relations with the Christians, all
the country was at peace and in tranquillity. The following day they
came again, and he showed them much affection, and gave them and their
relatives many presents, besides paying for all the provisions they
brought, so that they remained well satisfied. And because they were the
principal chiefs of those natives, the governor spoke to them in the
kindest way, and recommended them to keep peace in all that land, and
be diligent in serving and visiting the Spaniards at Ascension, obeying
the orders of His Majesty. They answered, that since they had made
peace they were determined to keep it, as he would see. In proof of
their obedience, Atabare offered to accompany them, being a man well
experienced in warfare, and Guaçani said he would remain at home and see
that peace was not broken. The governor thought well of all this, and
liking the offer made by Atabare, he deemed it prudent to accept it,
because if this chief went with him there would be additional security
for the observance of peace. He therefore agreed to his coming, and gave
him richer presents than he had ever done before, for it was certain
that by keeping this chief satisfied the whole country would remain
at peace, and nobody would dare to raise a rebellion. So the governor
earnestly recommended the Christians to the good offices of Guaçani, who
promised to accomplish all he had undertaken. The governor remained four
days at this place, conferring with those chiefs and their people, and
giving them presents.

When they were about to leave this port, the horse of the factor Pedro
Dorantes died, so he told the governor he did not feel disposed to
continue in the discovery and conquest of that province without a horse,
and begged that he might be allowed to return to the city of Ascension,
leaving as his deputy his son, Pedro Dorantes, to serve in the office of
factor. This youth was admitted to the said office in the place of his
father and allowed to accompany the expedition.

Atabare, the Indian chief, set out in company with the governor,
together with thirty relatives and dependents, in three canoes. Sailing
from the port of Guaçani, the expedition navigated up the Rio
Paraguai, and on Friday, the 24th of September, arrived at the port of
Ipaneme,[341] where the governor ordered the brigantines to be moored
in order to communicate with the Indians who were vassals of the king,
as well as because he had heard that among those Indians there was a
Guaraní who had lived for a long while in captivity with the Payaguás
and knew their language, their country, and villages. He wished to take
him with him as interpreter to the Payaguás, who had slain Juan de
Ayolas and other Christians, and obtain in a peaceful way the gold and
silver of which they had robbed that leader.

  [341] River Ipané.

As soon as he arrived at the port all the natives came towards him, much
pleased and laden with provisions. The governor received them kindly and
gave orders that they should be paid for all they brought. To the chiefs
he gave many presents, and having spoken and dealt with them, he gave
them to understand the necessity he was in of having that Indian as
interpreter, so as to bring about friendly relations with the Payaguás,
and to guide his army by the best route to the settlements of the
interior. Then these Indians immediately sent in search of him, to find
him out with the least possible delay.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-SEVENTH.

    _How he sent for an interpreter to treat with the Payaguás._


THREE days after the natives of Ipaneme had sent in search of the Indian
interpreter, he arrived at the port where the governor was staying, and
offered to accompany him on his expedition and show him the country of
the Payaguás. Then the governor set sail from that port and went further
up the river Paraguai, and in four days' time arrived at the port of
Guayviano, which is the extreme point occupied by the Guaranís. Here he
ordered his vessels to be moored, in order that he might speak with the
natives, who came to see him with their chiefs, laden with provisions,
and the governor received them very well, and treated them and their
chiefs in the same gracious manner. These natives informed him that
his cavalry were marching through the country, and had already passed
through some of their settlements, where they had been well received
and provisioned, and that they had been directed on the road to
Itabitan,[342] where they intended to await the arrival of the
brigantines. As soon as he heard these tidings the governor ordered
his flotilla to set sail, and departed from the port of Guayviano, and,
having a fair wind, went on navigating up the river. That same day, at
nine o'clock in the morning, he reached the port of Itabitan, where he
found his cavalry arrived in good condition. They informed him that
they had travelled through the country, keeping on good terms with the
inhabitants, to whom they had distributed the gifts they had taken with
them.

  [342] Itapuan.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-EIGHTH.

    _How the horses were embarked in the port._


CABEZA DE VACA remained two days in the port of Itabitan, during which
time the horses were embarked and everything concerning the armada
arranged in orderly fashion. The country of the Payaguás being now near
at hand, he ordered that the Indian interpreter from Ipaneme should be
taken on board the leading vessel and give directions as to what had to
be done. He then set sail with a fair wind from that port. In order
to protect the Guaranís who were with him from the attacks of the
Payaguás, he ordered the former to unite their canoes in one body and
keep close to the brigantines, and in this way pursue their voyage in
good order. At night he directed that all the flotilla should moor
alongside the bank, he himself sleeping on shore with a strong guard,
the canoes of the Guaranís being attached to the brigantines. The
Spaniards and Indians occupied a full league of land along the river,
and their numerous camp-fires presented a very pretty sight. During all
this navigation the governor provided food for all the people, Spaniards
and Guaranís, and supplied them well with everything--fish in great
abundance and game, so that they had more than they could eat. In this
river there is a kind of wild pig that is constantly in the water,
larger than ours in Spain; these animals are aquatic in their habits,
remaining on land at night, while in the daytime they are always in the
water, and when they see a person they plunge into the river and sink to
the bottom, remaining a long time under water.[343] When they reappear
on the surface of the water they are at an arrow's flight from the place
where they dived. In the chase of this pig not less than six canoes take
part, for, when the animal dives, three go up the river and three go
down. The hunters have their bows ready, and, as the animal comes to the
surface, they shoot three or four arrows with great rapidity at them
before they dive again, and so they pursue them till at length they
float on the surface dead of their wounds. Their flesh is considered
good to eat by the Spaniards, and there is plenty of it, many parts of
this river abounding with these pigs. Our people were so strong and
lusty on this voyage that they looked as though they had just arrived
from Spain. The horses, too, were in good condition; they were taken on
shore several times to hunt deer, tapirs, wild boar, many otters, and
other animals.

  [343] This amphibious animal is called _capibara_, i.e., _capincho_,
  or water-hog.




CHAPTER THE FORTY-NINTH.

    _How Juan de Ayolas entered the port where he and his Christians
    were killed._


ON the 12th October the governor arrived at the port of Candelaria,
and the country of the Payaguás. It was here that Captain Juan de
Ayolas entered with his Spaniards, and hither he returned after his
exploration, expecting to find Domingo de Irala, whom he had left in
charge of the brigantines, which he had taken with him. Here he remained
four months awaiting their arrival, during which time he and his men
suffered terribly from hunger. At length the Payaguás, having learned
of his weak condition and want of arms, began treating him with
familiarity, and offered to receive him and his men into their houses
and support them. Then they suddenly fell upon them as they were
crossing some marshes full of rushes; every Christian was seized by two
Indians armed with poles who struck them several blows on the head, and
so they slew Captain Juan de Ayolas and eighty Spaniards, being all that
remained of the one hundred and fifty who had gone on that expedition.
The blame of their death rests with him who had been left in charge of
the brigantines, and who, instead of awaiting their return, abandoned
them to their fate, and descended the river to please himself. Had Juan
de Ayolas found the brigantines there when he returned, he would have
embarked and escaped massacre at the hands of these Indians. But Domingo
de Irala acted with bad faith, to the intent that Juan de Ayolas might
be slain, and that he might raise a revolt in the land against God and
the king. This he afterwards succeeded in, and, to the present day, he
is actually in revolt, having destroyed and laid waste all that land,
and for twelve years he continues to govern it tyrannically.[344]

  [344] This is reckoned from the end of Alvar Nunez's government, 1543,
  to the date of publication of this work in Valladolid, 1555.

The pilots observed here to obtain the elevation of the pole, and found
the latitude of that port to be in twenty-one degrees less one-third
of a degree.[345] Having arrived here, the armada was assembled before
opening communications with the Payaguás and ascertaining where their
settlements were situated. The following morning, at eight o'clock,
seven Payaguás appeared on the bank of the river, and the governor
ordered an equal number of Spaniards, together with the interpreter
(who proved very useful), to treat with them, as they were desirous of
speaking with them, and of coming to a peaceful arrangement, the captain
of the expedition having no other object but that of peace. Having
conversed a little while, the Indians asked if these Christians, who had
now arrived in the brigantines, were the same as those who formerly
went about the country. The Spaniards, who had been warned beforehand,
answered that they were not the same as those others, but were newly
arrived in the country. Upon this, one of the Payaguás came among the
Christians, and was immediately brought before the governor. He asked
him, through the interpreter, by whose order he had come. The man
answered that his chief, having learned of the arrival of the Spaniards,
had sent him to inquire if it were true they were the same people as
those who went formerly in the country, and to say that his chief wished
to be the friend of the governor, and that all that had been taken from
Juan de Ayolas and from the Christians was kept together, and placed in
security ready to be restored to the chief of the Christians, in order
that peace might be made with them, and to obtain pardon for the murder
of Ayolas and the other Christians who had been slain in war. The
governor then asked him how much gold and silver they had taken from
Juan de Ayolas and from the Christians, and he showed, by signs, that
it would amount to sixty-six loads such as the Chanés Indians are
accustomed to carry, and that it was all in plates, bracelets, crowns,
and axes; also that there were small vases of gold and silver. Alvar
Nunez charged that Indian, through the interpreter, to tell his chief
that His Majesty had sent him to that land to establish peace with them
and other tribes that would accept it, and that the past wars would be
forgiven. He added that if his chief sought friendship, and would be
willing to restore all that had been taken from the Spaniards, he
should come in person and speak with him (the governor), as he was very
desirous of seeing him, and would treat him well, and receive him as a
vassal of the king. In token of peace, he sent him several presents, and
gave other things as well to the Indian himself, and asked him when he
would return with his chief.

  [345] This is an error of one and two-thirds of a degree. The exact
  latitude of _Candelaria_ was 19 degrees, where now is Corumbá.

This chief, though a fisherman, is lord of this miserable people (for
all are fishermen); he is a very grave man, feared and respected by his
people, and, if anyone offend him and make him angry, he takes a bow,
and shoots two or three arrows into him. If the man be killed, he sends
for the wife (if there be one), and gives her a bead to appease her
wrath at the murder of her husband. If he have no bead to give her,
then a couple of feathers. When this chief wishes to spit, one that is
nearest to him joins his hands together so that he should spit into
them. These, and such like extravagances, are practised by this chief.
All along the river there is no Indian that owns such things as he does.
The interpreter promised that he and his chief would be there again the
next morning, and so he left the governor in expectation.




CHAPTER THE FIFTIETH.

    _How the interpreter and those who had promised to come failed to
    do so._


THAT day and four more having passed without the return of the Indian
Payaguá, the governor sent for the interpreter, and asked him what he
thought of this delay. And he said that he believed the chief would
certainly never make his appearance, because the Payaguás are very sly
and cautious; that the chief's motive for sending an envoy to treat for
peace was only to gain time and prevent the Spaniards and Guaranís from
advancing and finding out the settlements of the Payaguás, and that
while they (the Spaniards) were waiting the arrival of the chief, the
Payaguás were removing their settlements, wives, and children, and that
he thought they had fled to some place of concealment higher up the
river. He advised the governor to follow, as he was certain that he
would overtake them, because he knew they would be heavily loaded. In
his opinion, the Payaguás would continue their flight till they reached
a lagoon formerly inhabited by a tribe called the Mataraes, whom these
Payaguás had slain and destroyed and had taken possession of their land
because it abounded in fisheries.

The governor immediately gave orders to raise anchors, and brigantines
and canoes went on navigating up the river. Wherever he halted, great
numbers of the Payaguás might be seen along the bank, who, as the
interpreter had said, were going by land with their wives and children,
because the canoes could not contain them. After eight days' navigation
the governor arrived at the lagoon of the Mataraes, and entered it,
without finding the Indians he was in search of there. He entered with
half his people to seek them out and treat with them, but seeing they
did not appear, and in order not to waste his provisions, he ordered all
the Christians and Guaranís to return. They had found certain canoes
with their paddles concealed under the water, and had seen the track by
which the Indians had withdrawn; but the governor would not delay any
longer, so, reassembling his people and collecting all the brigantines
and canoes together, he pursued his navigation up the river, sometimes
sailing, at other times rowing and towing, because of the many bends in
its course, till he arrived at a part of its banks where many cassia
trees grow.

These are very lofty and vigorous trees, yielding a fruit one palm and a
half in length and as thick as three fingers. The people ate much of it,
and the inside is as sweet as honey. It does not differ the least from
that kind which is brought into Spain from other countries, except that
it is much larger and rougher to the taste, because it is uncultivated.
There are eighty of these trees united together on the bank of the
Paraguai. In these parts of the river there was an abundance of wild
fruit, which the Spaniards and Indians ate. Among them was one like a
lemon of Ceuti in colour, acidity, peel, and smell, but smaller, no
larger than the size of a pigeon's egg. The tree bearing this fruit has
leaves like a lemon. There is a great variety of trees and fruits in
this country, and a wonderful diversity of fish, the quantity killed
by the Indians and Spaniards surpassing belief. Whenever the wind was
unfavourable for sailing they hunted the water-pigs and otters (which
were also abundant), using for this purpose the light, swift canoes of
the natives. This was a great pastime.

As we were now approaching the country of the Guaxarapos Indians, who
inhabit the bank of the Paraguai, and are neighbours and traffic with
the port of Los Reyes, for which we were bound, and as these Indians
might have been alarmed at such a multitude of people and canoes, and
might have fled inland, the governor, in order to allay their fears
and pacify them, divided his flotilla into two parts, and, taking five
brigantines and half the canoes, led the advance, leaving Captain
Gonzalo de Mendoza to follow with the other vessels, canoes, and
people, charging him to govern all the people kindly and not abuse
his authority. He particularly warned him not to allow any wrongs or
violence to be committed upon the native riverine population, and to pay
for all the provisions he took, so as to keep the peace and safeguard
His Majesty's interests in that land. Taking with him the five
brigantines and the canoes, the governor continued his voyage as I have
stated, and, on the 18th October, arrived at a settlement of Guaxarapos
Indians. Here thirty Indians having come out, he halted his flotilla
within earshot, and addressed them through the interpreter, repeating
what he had said to the other tribes lower down the river, exhorting
them to give their submission to the king, and promising, if they did
so, he would regard them as friends. They accordingly submitted; one
of their number was a chief, to whom the governor gave presents and
promised to do what he could for them.

Not far from the place where we met these Indians flowed another river.
It is about half the width of the Paraguai, with a violent current, and
it falls into this river, which comes from Brazil.[346] This was the
river along which, old men tell, Garcia the Portuguese came and made war
in that land. He entered it at the head of a large number of Indians,
fought many battles, and destroyed many tribes, having only five
Christians with him. The Indians say that he was never seen to return.
He brought with him a mulatto named Pacheco, who returned to the country
of Guaçani, who killed him on the spot. Garcia returned to Brazil. Of
his Guaraní followers many are said to have been lost in the interior,
and the natives told us that we should find many of them there from
whom we might obtain information concerning the deeds of Garcia and the
nature of the country. Some Indians, called Chaneses, had also sought
refuge there, and had allied themselves with the Sococies and Xaquetes,
who live near the port of Los Reyes.

  [346] This river must have been the Cuyabá.

Having obtained this information from the Indians the governor pushed
on to see the river by which Garcia had come, for he was near the place
indicated by the Guaxarapos. When he had arrived at the mouth of the
river called Iapaneme, he caused soundings to be taken, and the depth
was found to be very great. This river has a rapid current, and is
bordered on either bank by trees. Cabeza de Vaca ordered one of the
brigantines to ascend it for a league and continue the soundings, all
of which proved its depth to be great. The Guaxarapos said that along
its banks lived various tribes, who cultivated maize and manioc and
had large fisheries, obtaining as much fish as they could eat, and
extracting oil from these fish, besides killing a quantity of game. The
party sent to explore this river reported having seen smoke in several
places on the banks--a sign of settlements. It was already late when
the exploring party returned, and the governor ordered that the vessels
should be moored that night off the mouth of that river, at the foot of
a range of hills called Santa Lucia. This sierra was crossed by Garcia.
The following morning the pilots observed the elevation, and found the
estuary of the river to be in nineteen degrees and one-third.[347] That
night a heavy fall of rain, accompanied by a strong wind, caused us
great inconvenience. Great fires were made on shore, and many of the
people slept by them, while the others remained on board the vessel
under coverings of mats and skins.

  [347] This is an error. The mouth of the river Cuyabá is in 18° lat.




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FIRST.

    _How the Guaxarapos spoke with the governor._


THAT morning the Guaxarapos, who had been the previous day to speak with
the governor, came again in two canoes with supplies of fish and meat,
which they distributed among our people, and, having spoken once more
with the governor, and received promises of friendship and protection,
took their departure. He told them of the other vessels, canoes, and
soldiers that were behind, and begged them to receive them kindly and
treat them well, as in such case they would suffer no injury; this they
promised they would do, but did not keep their word. The cause of this
was certainly a Christian, who was punished for it, as I shall presently
relate.

The governor left those Indians, and continued his navigation of the
river all that day with a fair wind, arriving at sunset at certain
settlements belonging to the same tribe of Indians on the river shore,
near the water's edge; but in order not to lose time, and favourable
weather for the voyage, he passed on without stopping. These people are
agriculturists, sowing maize and other roots, hunting and fishing a
great deal, both fish and game being abundant. Men and women wear the
skins of wild animals, except a few, who only cover their privities.
They tattoo their faces in points and lines, and pierce the lips and
ears. Their canoes are only large enough to contain two or three persons
at a time. They are exceedingly light, and the skill with which they
manage them is admirable. When going up or down the river, the motions
of these canoes are so swift that they appear to be flying. A brigantine
(though made of cedar wood), and whether propelled by oars or sail,
cannot overtake one of these skiffs, though the latter have only two
oars, whereas the brigantines have a dozen. They fight in their canoes
on the river as well as on land; nevertheless, they traffic with one
another, bartering bows and arrows for canoes, which are supplied to
them by the Guaxarapos and Payaguás, besides other things. So they
become, by turns, friends and enemies with one another.




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SECOND.

    _How the Indians come and establish themselves on the shore of
    the river._


WHEN the waters are low, the people from the interior come and live on
the banks of the river with their wives and children, and pass their
time in fishing, for the fish are abundant and very fat at this season.
They lead pleasant lives, dancing and singing day and night, like
persons who are relieved from all anxiety about food; but when the water
begins to rise, which is in January, they retire inland, because at that
season the floods begin, and the waters rise six fathoms above the banks
of the river. At such time the country is under water for over one
hundred leagues inland, spreading over everything like a sea, so that
even tall palms and other trees are covered, and vessels may pass over
their summits. This usually happens every year, when the sun crosses one
tropic and approaches the other in the latitude of the mouth of the _rio
del oro_. At such times the natives keep very large canoes in readiness
for this emergency; and in the middle of these canoes they throw two or
three loads of mud, and make a hearth. The Indian then enters with his
wife, children, and household goods, and floats on the rising tide
wherever they like. He lights a fire on the hearth to cook his food and
for warmth, and thus he voyages for four months of the year, or as long
as the floods last. While the waters are rising he lands at certain
spots not yet inundated, and kills deer, tapirs, and other wild animals
which have escaped the flood. As these retire into their channels, he
returns the same way, hunting and fishing, and not leaving his canoe
till the banks whereon he is wont to dwell are uncovered.

It is a sight to see the enormous quantity of fish left on the dry land
after the waters have subsided. This happens in the month of March or
April, when all that country smells awfully bad, owing to the poisonous
mud which covers it. At this period all the natives, and we ourselves,
were very ill, so that we thought we should die; and, as it is then
summer in these parts, it is barely endurable. In the month of April
the sick begin to recover.

All these Indians spin the thread, of which they make their nets, of a
kind of teasel. These teasels are pounded and thrown into muddy pools;
after leaving them there fifteen days, they take them out and scrape
them with mussel-shells; the fibre is then clean and white as snow.

This tribe, unlike others, has no chief; they are all fishers and
woodsmen, inhabiting the borders of the country. These, and all the
other people living on the river by which we were now passing, would not
suffer any Spaniard or Guaraní to land. In order that they should not
molest his people, the governor distributed some presents among them,
and told them of the other ships that were following with his friends,
whom he begged them to receive and entertain well.

Continuing the voyage one Friday morning, we arrived at a rapid, where
the river passes between steep rocks. Large quantities of gold-fish
(_dorados_) descend this rapid, and it was the largest rapid we had
yet met with. We passed it sailing and rowing. Here the Spaniards and
Indians caught in one hour large quantities of gold-fish, as many as
forty of them being taken by one man. These fish are so big that they
weigh half an arroba[348] each, and some as much as one arroba. They are
excellent eating, the head being the best part. A quantity of oil is
extracted from these fish, and those who eat of it become fat and sleek.
Broth made of them, if taken continuously for a month, cures skin
diseases and leprosy.

  [348] The arroba is a Spanish weight, equal to twenty-five pounds of
  sixteen ounces each.

Continuing the voyage with a fair wind, the governor arrived, on the
evening of the 25th October, at a place where the river divides into
three channels. One arm forms a great lagoon, which the Indians call the
Black River; it runs towards the north into the interior of the country.
The other arms, in which the water is of a good colour, reunite a little
way further down. The governor continued his navigation till he came to
the mouth of a river which flows into the interior of the country to the
left, towards the west. Here the Paraguai loses itself in a number of
other river channels and lagoons. And the navigation is so intricate
that the Indians themselves, who are always navigating them, have
difficulty in distinguishing one from the other, and often lose their
way. The river now entered by the governor is called by the natives
Yguatu,[349] meaning "good water." It flows towards the lagoon in our
favour. Hitherto we had been ascending against the current; we now went
down stream.

  [349] I believe the name is Igatú, now Jaurú.




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-THIRD.

    _How they erected three crosses at the mouth of the river Yguatú._


THE governor ordered several sign-posts to be made at the mouth of this
river of felled trees. He then had three high crosses erected to serve
as signs for vessels, in order that they might not mistake the entrance.
During three days we advanced by rowing; then we left the river, and
ascended two of its arms which have their source in large lagoons.

On the eighth of the month, one hour before daybreak, we arrived at
some high and round craggy rocks in the middle of the river. They are
bell-shaped, contracting towards the summit. These rocks are completely
barren, producing neither tree nor herb. Their colour is red. We
believe they contain much metal, because the country beyond the river
is mountainous, forested, and clothed with grass; these rocks, on the
other hand, have nothing of the kind, an indication that they contain
much metal, because, wherever this is found, neither trees nor grasses
grow. The Indians told us that, in bygone times, their forefathers
obtained white metal here; but as all our people were ill, and as we
had no mining nor founder's tools with us, nor the implements necessary
to probe and search for ore, the governor did not cause search to be
made for the metal, leaving it for another time when he passed by that
way again, for these rocks are near the port of Los Reyes.

Pursuing our voyage up the river, we entered a lagoon upwards of one
league and a half in width at its entrance, and, issuing from it by a
second mouth, came to the dry land. At ten o'clock in the morning we
anchored at the entrance of another lagoon where the Sacosies, Xaqueses,
and Chaneses had established their settlements. The governor did not
wish to go any further without acquainting the Indians of his arrival.
He accordingly sent an interpreter with some Christians in a canoe to
speak with them in his name and summon them to an interview. These
envoys returned at five o'clock in the evening, and announced that the
Indians had come forth to receive them, showing great pleasure, and
telling the interpreter that they already knew of their arrival and were
desirous of seeing the governor and the Christians. They reported that
the waters had fallen a good deal, and by reason of this it had been
difficult to take their canoe there; that in order to pass the shallows
and arrive at the port of Los Reyes, it would be necessary to lighten
the vessels, as the depth was only one span, whereas the draught of the
loaded brigantines was five or six. These shallows were near the port of
Los Reyes. The following day the governor ordered the departure of the
ships and of all the people, Christians and Indians. They rowed till
they came to the shallows, when everybody had orders to get into the
water, which did not reach to the knee. Then the Indians and Christians
ranged themselves round the sides of the brigantine named _St. Mark_,
and pushed with their shoulders, nearly lifting her out of the water by
the strength of their arms without unloading her. That shallow was more
than an arquebuss shot and a half long, and the difficulty of passing it
was very great. When this was over, the other brigantines were passed
in the same way with less trouble, because they were smaller. Having
floated them into deep water we disembarked at Los Reyes, where we found
a great assemblage of natives with their wives and children waiting for
us. The governor and all his people landed, and the natives came towards
them. He told them that he had been sent by His Majesty to warn them to
be Christians and receive the Christian doctrine, to believe in God the
creator of heaven and earth, and to be the vassals of the king. If they
did this they would be protected and defended against their enemies and
against all who would injure them, and that they would be well treated
and looked after in accordance with His Majesty's orders; if they
conducted themselves well he would not fail to give them presents, as he
always did to those who were good. He then convoked the clergy and told
them he wished a church built where Mass could be said and other divine
rites celebrated for an example and comfort to the other Christians;
and he charged them to have a special care of these. He ordered a large
wooden cross to be erected on the bank of the river, under some tall
palms, in the presence of the officers and many others there present. He
took formal possession of the country in the name of His Majesty, and
in the presence of the notary, as newly discovered land, and, having
conciliated the natives by bestowing presents upon them, he ordered the
Spaniards and Guaranís to take up their quarters on the shore of the
lagoon, cautioning them to do the natives no injury or violence, because
they were friendly, and vassals of the king. Moreover, he gave them
strict orders not to enter the native settlements and houses, because
what the Indians fear and hate most, and what irritates them more than
anything, is to see the Christians, accompanied by Indians, entering
their houses, disturbing their things, and taking away the few
possessions they have. If they trafficked with them, they were to
pay for whatever they bought, or they would be punished.




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FOURTH.

    _How the Indians of the port of Los Reyes cultivate the soil._


THE Indians of this port of Los Reyes are agriculturists, and sow maize
and manioc (the cassava of the Indies), and an abundance of _mandubies_
(which are like large filberts). They sow twice a year. The land is
fertile, abounding in provisions, game, and fisheries. These Indians
rear numbers of geese, as a protection against crickets (as I have
described). They also rear fowls, and shut these up at night to protect
them from bats, which cut off their combs, and, in this way, cause their
death. These bats are an evil kind of animal, and numerous on the banks
of the river. They are larger than our doves in Spain, with teeth so
sharp that their bite is not felt. They never bite a man except in the
toes and the tip of the nose. When several persons are together, and
this animal has bitten one, he will not touch the others, but never
leaves that one he has attacked. They bite at night, but never appear
in the day-time. We had great difficulty in protecting our horses' ears
from them. When a bat enters a stable, the horses become so frightened
that they waken all the people in the house, and it is impossible to
quiet them till the bat has been killed or driven out. The governor was
bitten by one of those animals while he was asleep in a brigantine, one
of his feet being uncovered. All night the blood kept on flowing, till
he woke from feeling his leg cold, and finding the bed soaked with
blood, thought somebody had wounded him; but those on board searched for
the place where he was wounded, and, when they found what they knew, by
experience, to be the bite of a bat, they laughed. The governor found
that a slice of his toe had been bitten off. These bats always bite
where there is a vein. They served us a bad trick on one occasion. When
we were starting on our voyage of exploration we had six pregnant sows,
and hoped to rear a race of pigs. When the little pigs were born, and
tried to suck their mother, they could not find her teats, because these
had been bitten off by the bats; so the young pigs died, and we had to
eat the sows, because they were unable to rear their young.

There are other bad animals in this country; these are very large ants
of two kinds, red and black. It is most pitiable to see a person who has
been stung by either of these ants, for he utters loud cries, and rolls
on the ground for twenty-four hours, during which the pain lasts; and
there is no remedy for it. There are very many rays in this lagoon,
and, if a fisherman happen to tread on one, it bends its body up, and
inflicts a smart blow with the tip of its tail, which is about the
thickness of a finger, and has a saw-like edge. This fish is about the
size of a _xeme_,[350] and, if the blow it delivers strike the foot,
it goes right through, and the pain is as intense as that from the
ant-stings; but it may be stopped at once by chewing and applying to
the wound a certain weed the Indians know of. This takes the pain away
completely, though the wound does not heal for a month.

  [350] The _xeme_ is the span from the extremity of the thumb to that
  of the forefinger, when stretched to their utmost, equal to about six
  inches.

The natives of this country are of average height. They are quite naked,
and pierce holes in their ears large enough to pass the fist through; in
these they insert gourds of a medium size, afterwards replacing them by
larger ones, distending the lobe of the ear till it hangs down to the
shoulder. For this reason they are called _Orejones_, like the Incas of
Peru. When they fight, they take these gourds or discs out of their ears
and roll them up, or else tie their ears behind their heads. The women
do not cover their nakedness. Every person lives separately with his
wife and children. The occupation of the women is to spin cotton; the
men cultivate the fields, returning to their homes in the evening,
when they find their meals ready. The women do no other work except at
harvest time, when they assist in gathering the maize, and garnering it.
From that place the Indians begin to be idolaters; they worship idols
made of wood; but, according to the reports brought to the governor,
those farther inland have idols of gold and silver.

The governor tried, with kind words, to turn the natives of Los Reyes
from idolatry, persuading them to burn their idols, and believe only in
God, who created heaven and earth, man, the sea, fish, and every living
creature, and that he whom they worshipped was the devil, who deceived
them. They burned some of their idols, but their chiefs were frightened,
saying the devil would kill them, and that he would be angry with them.
As soon as the church was built, and Mass had been said, the devil fled
from that country and left the Indians in peace and tranquillity. This
was the first settlement of the _campo_; it was a little over half a
league in extent, and contained eight hundred houses of agriculturists.




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FIFTH.

    _How the Indians of Garcia settled in this place._


HALF a league off there was a small village of about seventy houses,
belonging to the same tribe of Sacocies, and four leagues farther two
villages of Chaneses, who settled in this country, and took wives
when Garcia came from the interior. A number of them came to see the
governor, and said they were friendly with Christians because of
the kind treatment they had experienced from Garcia[351] when they
followed him from their own country. Some of them had glass beads
and other things which they said Garcia had given them. They are all
agriculturists, and rear geese and fowls, the latter like those of
Spain. The governor treated them well, and gave them presents, receiving
them as vassals of His Majesty. He begged them to be faithful to the
king, and good to the Christians, adding that, if they conducted
themselves well, he would favour and treat them better than they had
yet been treated.

  [351] Of course, this is not the Pilot Diego Garcia who went at the
  same time as Sebastian Cabot, nor the fabulous Alejo Garcia mentioned
  by some writers as having been in Paraguai before them.




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SIXTH.

    _How they spoke with the Chaneses._


THE governor informed himself through these Chaneses about the interior
of the country, and concerning its settlements, how many days' journey
these were from the port of Los Reyes. The chief of the Chaneses, who
was about fifty years of age, said that when Garcia brought them from
their country they accompanied him through the lands of the Mayáes[352]
to those of the Guaranís, who slew the Indians he brought with him, and
this chief and others of his tribe escaped, and fled along the bank of
the Paraguai, up this river till they came to the settlement of the
Sacosies, who received them. They durst not go home the way they came
with Garcia, for fear lest the Guaranís should overtake and kill them.
They could not say, therefore, how far it was to the villages of the
interior; this circumstance, and their ignorance of the road, prevented
them from returning to their country. The Guaranís, however, inhabiting
the mountainous region knew the way, and could show it, for they were
accustomed to come and go in their wars against the Indians of the
interior. In answer to questions put to him about the inhabitants of his
country, their manner of life, and mode of making war, he said that all
the people in his land obeyed one chief, who was over all, and many of
his tribe were at war with Indians, called _Chimencos_ and _Carcaracs_,
and there were numerous other tribes in that land, known as the
Gorgototquies, Paysunóes, Esterapecócies and Candirées, who had all
their own chiefs, and made war. Their weapons are bows and arrows, and
they are mostly agriculturists. They rear animals, sow maize, manioc,
potatoes and _mandubies_, and keep geese and fowls like those of Spain.
They also rear large sheep (_llamas_), and make war one upon the other.
They barter bows and arrows, mantles, and other things for bows, arrows,
and women. Having given this information, these Indians went away
well satisfied. Their chief offered to accompany the governor on his
expedition of discovery, saying that he would return to his country with
his wife and children, and what he most desired was to live in his own
country.

CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SEVENTH.

    _How the governor sent to find out the Indians of Garcia._


HAVING obtained all the information he could from the Indian chief, the
governor ordered some Spaniards to go and find out the Guaranís of that
land, in order to get information from them and guides for his voyage of
discovery. Some Guaranís of those he had brought with him accompanied
the Spaniards, who set out preceded by guides. At the end of six days
they returned and reported that those Guaranís had left the country,
for they had found the villages and houses deserted, and the whole
region depopulated since they had gone for ten leagues round it, without
finding a living soul. Having heard this, the governor asked the
Chaneses if they knew into what part the Guaranís had gone. They
answered that the natives of that port and island had joined together,
and made war against those Guaranís, and had killed many of them; the
remainder had fled into the interior. They believed that the Guaranís
would join with other tribes of the same nation, who lived near to a
people called Xarayes, against whom, and other tribes, they were at war.
According to their information, the Xarayes possess gold and silver
given to them by the Indians of the interior; in that direction all the
country is inhabited, and he might go to those settlements. The Xarayes,
they added, are agriculturists: they sow maize and other seeds in large
quantities, rear geese and poultry like those of Spain.

The governor asked how many days' march it was from the port of Los
Reyes to the Xarayes' land, and they answered that the journey could not
be made by land, because the road was very bad, owing to the numerous
swamps and lakes, but that if he chose to go thither by water in canoes,
it would take eight or ten days.




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-EIGHTH.

    _How the governor held a council with his officers and informed them
    of what was passing._


SOON after this the governor convoked the officers and the clergy, and
having told them of the report made concerning the Xarayes and Guaranís
living on the frontier, it was decided that two Spaniards and two
Guaranís should go with some natives of the port to speak with the
Xarayes, and find out what kind of land it was, and collect information
concerning the settlements and tribes of the interior, and the road
thither; they were also to speak with the Guaranís, as from them they
would be more fully and surely informed of the truth. That very day the
two Spaniards started, and their names were Hector de Acuna and Antonio
Correa, interpreters of the Guaraní language, with ten Indian Sacosies,
and two Guaranís. The governor ordered them to tell the chief of the
Xarayes that they were envoys sent to speak with him, and contract
friendship with him and his people; that he begged him to come and see
him, as he wished for a personal interview. The Spaniards were moreover
desired to obtain information of the tribes and settlements in the
interior, and of the route leading thither. Alvar Nunez gave the
Spaniards several presents, and a scarlet cap to present to the chief
of the Xarayes, and another one for the chief of the Guaranís, to whom
they were to say the same as to the chief of the Xarayes.

The following day Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza arrived with his troops
and vessels, and reported that on the eve of All Saints' day, while
navigating past the country of the Guaxarapos, after speaking with this
people, who gave themselves out as friends (saying that they had done
the same with those who had passed before), the wind being contrary, and
the Spaniards about to moor the brigantines, just as the five leading
vessels were turning an elbow of the river, under sail, and one
brigantine, commanded by Agustin de Campos, was behind, being towed
along the shore, the Guaxarapos, seeing that its crew were all ashore,
attacked them, and killed five Christians; and that Juan de Bolanos,
while trying to swim to the vessel, was drowned. Our people had thought
they were so safe, and were so confident, believing the Indians to
be friendly, that they were not on their guard. Had not the other
Christians escaped to the brigantine, they would all have been killed,
because they were entirely unarmed. The death of these Christians did
great harm to our reputation, for the Guaxarapos, who were in the habit
of coming in their canoes to the port of Los Reyes, spread the news how
they had slain the Christians, asserting that we were not valiant, and
that our heads were soft, that the natives of that port ought to kill
us, and that they would help them to do this. From that time these
natives began to cherish evil designs against us.




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-NINTH.

    _How the governor sent an expedition to the Xarayes._


EIGHT days after Antonio Correa and Hector de Acuna, with their Indian
guides, had set out, as we have stated, for the country and villages of
the Xarayes, they returned to the port and told the governor what they
had seen, done, and learned about the country, the people, and their
chief. They brought with them an Indian whom the chief of the Xarayes
had sent as a guide for the discovery of the land. Antonio Correa and
Hector de Acuna said that, the very day of their departure from the port
of Los Reyes, they arrived at a village of Indians called Artaneses, who
are big men, and go naked. These people are agriculturists, but they sow
little, for they have not much land fit for cultivation, because most of
it is inundated, and covered with arid sand. They are poor, and subsist
chiefly by fishing in the lagoons near their villages. Their women are
very ugly, tattooing their faces with the tip of the ray's tail, which
they keep for this purpose, and they cover their nakedness.

These Indians are also hideous, owing to the habit they have of piercing
a hole in the lower lip, and inserting in it the husk of a fruit of a
certain tree, which is as large and round as a _tortero_.[353] This
weighs down, and distends the lip in a manner frightful to see. Antonio
Correa and his companion reported that the Indians had received them
well, and had given them what they had to eat. The next day they brought
them a guide. They had taken water to drink on their journey in gourds,
and had marched all that day through swamps,[354] sinking at each step
to the knees in mud, and withdrawing their feet with great difficulty.
The mud was so heated by the sun that it scorched their legs, and
produced painful wounds on them. That day they certainly thought they
would have died of thirst, for the water in the gourds only lasted half
the day. They slept on the open ground, between swamps, overcome with
fatigue, thirst, and hunger. The following day, at eight in the morning,
they came to a small lagoon of very muddy water, where they refilled
their gourds, which the Indians carried, and marched the whole day
through inundated land, as they had done the day before, except that
they found some lagoon water with which to refresh themselves, and a
tree with a little shade, where they reposed, and ate the remainder of
their provisions, without leaving anything over. The guides told them
that they had still a day's march before them to reach the settlements
of the Xarayes.

  [354] Cf. Schmidt, _supra_, p. 47.

Night having come, they rested, and at daybreak resumed their march.
Soon afterwards they came to other swamps, from which they thought
they would never extricate themselves, not only because of the painful
burning of their legs, but because they sank to the waist, and could
hardly get out. These swamps extended for a little over a league, and
then they found the way better and firmer. The same day, at one o'clock
in the afternoon, having eaten nothing, and not having the wherewithal
to satisfy their hunger, they met some twenty Indians who came towards
them. These people arrived with pleasure and joy, laden with maize,
bread, cooked geese, fish, and maize wine. They told the Spaniards that
their chief had learned of their coming to his country, and had ordered
them to bring food and speak to them on his behalf, and guide them to
where he and his people were, who would be glad to receive them. Thanks
to this food, Antonio Correa and his companions made up for their
previous fasting. The same day, one hour before night, they arrived
at the Indian settlements.

When they were a bow-shot off, upwards of five hundred Xarayes came
forth to receive them with great joy. All were elegantly attired with
parrots' feathers, and aprons of white beads to cover their nakedness.
They placed the Spaniards in their midst, and led them into the village,
at the entrance to which large numbers of women and children were
waiting for them. The women all had their privities covered, and many
of them wore wide cotton dresses, this material being in use among them
under the name of _tipoes_.

When the Spaniards had entered the village they came to where the chief
of the Xarayes was. He was surrounded by three hundred Indians of very
good appearance, mostly elderly men. This chief was seated on a cotton
hammock in the midst of a large open place, all his people standing
round him. They formed a lane by which the Spaniards might pass, and
when these had come into the presence of the chief, they brought two
little wooden stools, on which he signed to them to be seated. He then
sent for an Indian Guaraní, who had been long in their country. This
Indian had married a woman of their tribe, and was much loved by them,
and regarded as one of themselves.

By means of this interpreter, the chief then bade the Spaniards welcome,
and said how delighted they all were to see them, for he had long wished
to know the Christians. He had heard of them at the time of Garcia's
visit to that country, and looked upon them as friends and relatives; he
wished to make acquaintance with the chief of the Christians, because
he had been told that he was kind and friendly with the Indians, that he
gave them presents, and was generous, and he wished to know if the chief
had sent them for anything, because he would give it them. The Spaniards
told him, through the interpreter, that the governor had sent them to
learn from him the route he should follow to reach the settlements in
the interior, and to know by what tribes and villages he would have to
pass, and in how many days he might arrive at the Indians that had gold
and silver. They added that the object of their journey was also to
inform him that the governor wished to make his acquaintance and
contract an alliance with him. They spoke of all that the governor
desired them to say. The Indian replied: "I am rejoiced to have you as
my friends; I and my people consider the governor as our master; he has
only to command, and we will obey him. Concerning the road leading to
the settlements of the interior, I do not know of one, never having been
there, because all the country is under water for two months, and when
the waters subside the country is impassable. Nevertheless, the Indian
Guaraní, who is serving as interpreter, has been in the interior and
knows the road; to please the chief of the Christians I will send him to
be his guide." Thereupon, in the presence of all the people, he bade the
Guaraní accompany them, which he did very willingly.

The Spaniards having seen that the chief denied that there was a road,
for reasons which seemed to them after their experiences to be good and
true, believed him. They asked him, however, for guides to lead them
to the Guaraní settlements, because they were desirous of seeing and
talking with these people. At this request the Indian was much troubled,
and yet putting a good face on the matter, he answered, that the
Guaranís were his enemies, and he was constantly at war with them, and
hardly a day passed that they did not kill one another; and that since
he was the friend of the Christians, they should not go in search of his
enemies and contract an alliance with them. "However," he added, "if
you will go and visit these Guaranís, my people will conduct you there
to-morrow morning." As it was now night, the chief took them into his
house, and gave them to eat, and had hammocks prepared for them. He then
offered each of them a girl to sleep with, but they declined on the
score of fatigue.

The following morning, one hour before daybreak, a great noise of drums
beating and trumpets was heard, as though the whole village was falling
about their ears. On the square in front of the chief's house, all the
Indians were assembled in their feathers and war-paint, armed with bows
and arrows. Immediately the chief ordered the door of the house to be
thrown open, in order that they might see his six hundred warriors, and
he said to the Spaniards: "Christians, look at my people; it is thus
they go to the Guaraní villages; go with them; they will take you there,
and bring you back, for if you went alone they would kill you, knowing
that you have been with me, and are my friends." The Spaniards, seeing
that in this way they would not have been able to speak with the chief
of the Guaranís, and might lose the friendship of the Xarayes, answered
that they had made up their minds to return to their chief and inform
him of everything, and would see what he ordered, and then return and
let him know. In this way the Indians were pacified. All that day they
remained in the settlement of the Xarayes, which contained over one
thousand inhabitants, and one league off there were four other villages
of the same people, all of whom obeyed the said chief, whose name was
Camire.

These Xarayes are tall men, and well made; they are agriculturists,
sowing and reaping twice a year maize, potatoes, manioc, and mandubies.
They rear large numbers of geese and fowls like ours in Spain. They
pierce the lip like the Artaneses. Everyone lives separately with wife
and children; they hoe the ground and sow; the women gather the produce
and carry it to their houses; they spin much cotton. These Indians rear
geese to devour the crickets, as we have before described.




CHAPTER THE SIXTIETH.

    _How the interpreters came back from the Xarayes._


THESE Xarayes have large fisheries, both in the river and lagoons; they
also chase the deer. The Spaniards having remained the whole day with
the chief, gave him the presents and red cap sent him by the governor.
The chief was marvellously well pleased to receive them. He immediately
sent for head-dresses of parrots' feathers, and gave these to the
Christians to take to the governor; these ornaments were very elegant.
The Christians then took leave of Camire, who ordered twenty of his
Indians to accompany them. These men went with them as far as the
settlements of the Artaneses, and then returned home, leaving with the
Spaniards the guide given them by the chief. The governor received
him well, showing him much kindness, and at once asked him through
interpreters if he knew the road into the interior, to what tribe he
belonged, and about his country. He replied that he was a Guaraní, a
native of Itati, on the Paraguai; when he was a boy his tribe made a
great league of all the Indians of that country, and marched into the
interior. He followed his father and relatives to make war upon the
natives, and take from them plates and ornaments of gold and silver.

As soon as they arrived at the first settlements of the interior
they began making war, and slew many Indians. A great number of the
inhabitants took to flight, and sought refuge in the villages farther
inland. Very soon the tribes of that inner land joined together, and
came up against the Guaranís, defeated them, and slew many; others fled
in various directions. The enemy pursued and blocked the passes, thus
cutting off their retreat, and killed all those who were unable to
escape. He made signs to show that only two hundred of that great
multitude succeeded in making good their escape, and he was of this
number. The greater part remained in the forests through which they had
passed on their way out, not daring to go farther for fear of being
killed by the Guaxarapos, Guatos, and other tribes occupying those parts
which they would have to traverse. He did not remain with those who
settled in the forest region, but preferred accompanying those of his
countrymen who returned. One night, as they were on the march, they were
discovered by the tribes, who set upon them, and killed all, he alone
escaping into the recesses of the forests, and, continuing his march,
arrived at the country of the Xarayes, who spared his life and brought
him up. They took a fancy to him, married him to a woman of their own
tribe, and treated him as one of themselves. He was asked if he knew the
road taken by his people when they went into the interior. But he said
it was long ago that his countrymen advanced into that country, and that
as they went they opened a road, by cutting down trees and clearing the
ground, which was quite wild. He thought that the roads then made would
long ere this have been choked with weeds, for he had never been that
way since. Nevertheless, he thought that if he once found the road he
might continue in it. He added that the road began at a high, round
mountain in sight of Port Los Reyes. He was asked in how many days
the first settlement would be reached. He answered that, if his
memory served him right, in five days they would arrive at the first
settlement, where provisions were plentiful, and the people great
agriculturists; for though his people that went to that war destroyed
the inhabitants, and depopulated vast tracts, the country was beginning
to recover. Asked if there were large rivers and springs by the way, he
answered that the rivers he saw were not large, but there were other
copious streams, and there were springs and lakes, deer and tapirs, and
plenty of honey and fruits. To the question, if at the time when his
people made their expedition into that country he saw much gold and
silver among the natives, he answered that from those tribes they had
plundered much gold and silver plate, _barbotes_,[355] ear-rings,
bracelets, crowns, hatchets, and small vessels, but that these things
had been retaken when they were defeated; that those who escaped carried
some away, but that these were afterwards stolen by the Guaxarapos, who
killed them as they passed through their territory. A little of the
plunder probably remained with those who settled in the forest region,
and he had heard that the Xarayes had some also, for when these Indians
went to war against other Indians, he had seen them returning with
plates of silver which they had captured. He was asked if he would
accompany the Christians as guide. He answered yes, that he would gladly
do so, and that his master had sent him for that purpose. The governor
warned him to speak the truth concerning the road, for otherwise he
would have to pay dearly for it, but that if he spoke the truth he would
derive much benefit. He answered that what he had said was the truth, as
far as he knew, and that he was desirous of going with the Christians to
discover and find out the way.

  [355] These were the ornaments inserted in the lower lip.




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FIRST.

    _How the governor decided on entering the country._


HAVING obtained this information, the governor determined, in accordance
with the advice of the officers and clergy and captains, to penetrate
into the interior and discover the settlements there, and for this
purpose he chose three hundred arquebusiers and crossbowmen. As the
country through which they had to pass before they came to the inhabited
districts was deserted, he ordered them to take provisions for twenty
days. He ordered one hundred Christians to remain in the port to guard
the brigantines, with 200 Guaranís, and appointed Captain Juan Romero to
be their commander, for he knew the country. We left the port of Los
Reyes on the 26th November 1543. All that day we marched through cool
and shady forests, following our guide by a little frequented path. That
night we rested by the side of some streams of water, and the following
morning, one hour before daybreak, resumed our journey, sending twenty
men in advance with the guide to clear the road; for the further we went
the more closed we found it by trees and high, thick weeds, rendering it
very difficult to penetrate into the interior. That same day, at five
o'clock in the evening, we halted to pass the night by the side of a
great lagoon, where the Indians and Christians caught fish in their
hands. As we advanced, we ordered the guide to climb the trees and
hills to reconnoitre, and make certain we were on the right road to the
inhabited country.

The Guaranís, whom the governor had brought with him, supported
themselves on the provisions they had been allowed to take, on the honey
they extracted from trees, and by the chase of wild boar, tapirs, and
deer. Though game seemed plentiful, the expedition was so numerous, and
the noise made on the march was so great, that the wild animals took
fright, and not much was killed. The Indians and Spaniards also partook
of the wild fruits, found in abundance. None of these did them any
harm, except that of a tree resembling the myrtle, with a fruit similar
to that of the Spanish myrtle, but a little larger, and with a fine
flavour. All those who ate of it vomited, or had diarrhoa. These
effects, however, did not last long, and did no further harm. They also
made use of the palm-tree, which is common in that country. The date of
this palm is not edible, but the nut inside is round, and like a sweet
almond. The Indians make flour of it, and find it nourishing; the young
shoots of the palm are likewise very good eating.




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SECOND.

    _How the governor arrived at the Rio Caliente._


WE had marched five days in the country, following our guide, always
obliged to cut our way with infinite labour, when we came to a rivulet,
which falls from a mountain; its water is very warm, clear, and sweet;
and the Spaniards caught some fish in it. Here the guide began to be
embarrassed, saying that as it was a long time since he passed that way
he did not recognise it, and was at a loss how to guide us, the old
track having entirely disappeared. The next day the governor left the
Rio Caliente (river of warm water); and we followed the guide with great
trouble, cutting our way through forest, brushwood, and a multitude of
obstacles.

That same day, at ten o'clock in the morning, two Indian Guaranís
presented themselves before him, and said they were some of those who
had remained in those deserts after the wars waged by their tribesmen
against the people in the interior, when they were defeated and
massacred. They and their wives and children had concealed themselves in
the most inaccessible parts of the forest for fear of the natives, and
only fourteen of them survived; that at two days' journey there was a
hamlet of Guaranís, numbering ten persons, one of whom was a relative
of theirs, and that there were other Guaranís in the country of the
Xarayes, who were at war with this people. As these Indians seemed
frightened of the Christians and their horses, the governor ordered the
interpreter to reassure them, and asked them where they dwelt; they
answered that their homes were close by, and soon their wives and
children arrived with others of their relatives, who may have numbered
fourteen in all. These confirmed what the first two had said. On being
asked how they supported themselves in that country, and how long they
had inhabited it, they answered that they cultivated maize, and lived by
the chase, on honey and wild fruits, and that when their fathers were
killed they were children. The oldest of them might have been about
thirty-five years of age. They were asked if they knew the way thence to
the settlements of the interior, and how long it would take to arrive at
the inhabited land. They answered that as they were very young when they
were brought there, and had never made the journey since, they were
unable to direct us how to go, nor could they say how long it would take
to arrive at that region. But they added, their relatives, who lived
in the hamlet, two days' journey from theirs, had passed several times
by that road, and knew it. Perceiving that these Indians did not know
the road, the governor told them to go home, and dismissed them with
presents, with which they returned to their homes well satisfied.




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-THIRD.

    _How the governor sent to discover the house which was further on._


THE following day the governor sent an interpreter with two Spaniards
and two Indians to the house of which mention has been made, to
ascertain the road and the time it would take to reach the first
inhabited parts. He ordered that they should report as promptly as
possible to him any information they were able to obtain, in order that
he might take measures accordingly. The day after the departure of these
scouts he ordered his people to follow by short marches the route
they had taken. When they had thus been marching three days an Indian
arrived, bearing a letter for the governor from the interpreter, saying
that he had arrived at the house of the Indians, and had spoken with
the man who knew the road into the interior. This man had told him
that the first inhabited place was the summit of a rocky hill called
_Tapuaguazú_, that on reaching it a view might be obtained of a wide
extent of inhabited country, and that it might be sixteen days' journey
from his place to Tapuaguazú, and that the road thither was very
difficult because of the trees, thickets, and high grass, besides other
inconveniences. The interpreter added that since leaving the governor
they had found the country thickly forested and so difficult that they
had undergone great fatigues. For the greater part of the way they had
crawled on hands and feet, and, according to the Indian relative, the
road farther on was even worse. They intended bringing this Indian back
with them that the governor might obtain information direct from him.
Having read this letter, the governor followed the path by which the
messenger had come, but found it so thickly wooded and beset with
difficulties that it took a whole day to clear a passage the length of a
slinger's shot. Heavy rains having now set in, the governor ordered his
people to retire to the shelter huts they had left in the morning, for
fear of their suffering from wet and damping their ammunition.




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FOURTH.

    _How the interpreter returned from the Indian habitation._


THE interpreter returned at three o'clock of the afternoon of the
following day, bringing with him the Indian who said he knew the road.
The governor received him most kindly and gave him presents, with which
he was well pleased. He then ordered the interpreter to ask him in his
name to tell him all the truth about the road leading into the interior.
This Indian then said that he had not been that way for a long time,
though he knew it, and had gone by it several times to Tapuaguazú. From
the summit of that rocky hill, he affirmed, one might see the smoke of
all the villages. He used to go to Tapuaguazú to fetch arrows that are
to be had there, but for many days he had discontinued his visits to
that place, because on his way thither he observed the smoke of Indian
fires, by which he became aware that new settlements were being formed
in that deserted region.

Fearing for his life, he had not dared to go further along the path,
which is so obstructed that it can only be followed with much labour. He
thought that by cutting down trees and clearing a road they might reach
Tapuaguazú in sixteen days. He was asked if he would like to accompany
the Christians and show them the road; he answered that he would
willingly go, though he greatly feared the natives. Having heard the
information given by this Indian, and understood the difficulties of
the road, the governor convened a meeting of the officers, clergy,
and captains to consult with them what should be done to discover
the country. Having discussed the matter, they said that most of the
Spaniards were in want of provisions and had eaten nothing for three
days, and they dared not ask for it because of the disorder and
mismanagement that prevailed in its distribution. The first guide we had
taken had assured us that on the fifth day we should find provisions
and reach an inhabited country with plenty of commodities. Having put
faith in these promises, both Christians and Indians had improvidently
consumed all they brought with them, though every man had been supplied
with two arrobas of flour. The governor had, in their opinion, to
consider that there were barely six days' provisions left, and at the
end of that time there would be nothing for the people to eat. Under
these circumstances they thought it would be very dangerous to advance
further without means of subsistence, the more so because the Indians
are not as a rule precise in their indications, and it might happen
that, instead of sixteen days estimated by the guide, the time might
be greater, and that they might all die of starvation, as had happened
before to exploring expeditions in this country. They were, therefore,
of opinion that the security and lives of the Christians and Indians
depended upon their return to the port of Los Reyes, where they had left
their vessels. Once there, it would be easy to take fresh supplies and
recommence the discovery. Such was their advice, and, they added, if
necessary, they would require the governor in the name of His Majesty
to conform with it.




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FIFTH.

    _How the governor and his people returned to the Port of Los Reyes._


THE governor seeing the advice of the clergy, officers, and captains,
felt obliged to consider the necessities of his people, their difficult
position, and the desire all had to return. He nevertheless put before
them the inconvenience that would result from adopting such a course. He
said that it would be impossible to find sufficient provisions at Los
Reyes for so many people; that the maize was not yet ripe for harvest,
and that none could be obtained from the natives. He reminded them that
the natives had told them that the floods would soon begin, and these
would add seriously to their embarrassments. These and other reasons
pointed out by him, however, did not deter the Spaniards from persisting
in their determination to retire. Considering, therefore, their positive
wish, and being loath to give occasion to disturbances, which he would
have been obliged to punish, he conceded to their desires, and gave the
order to return to the Port of Los Reyes.

The following day he sent to Tapuá Captain Francisco de Ribera, who had
volunteered to go thither with six Christians and the guide who knew the
road. He furnished him with an escort of eleven Indian chiefs, whom he
charged not to leave the captain under threat of punishment. He at the
same time started with all his people for Los Reyes, where he arrived in
eight days, much dissatisfied at having gone no farther.




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SIXTH.

    _How the Indians would have killed those who remained at the Port
    of Los Reyes._


WHEN the governor had returned to the Port of Los Reyes, Captain Juan
Romero, whom he had left there as his lieutenant, reported that a few
days after his departure the natives of the island, which is one league
from the port, conspired to massacre all the Christians who had been
left there, and to obtain possession of the brigantines. To carry this
into effect, they summoned all the natives of the country to their
assistance. They formed a league with the Guaxarapos and several other
tribes, and had arranged to attack the Spaniards by night. Under pretext
of bartering they tried to tempt him to come out and buy provisions,
they having discontinued their supplies. Whenever they brought any it
was for the purpose of spying, and they openly told him they would come
and kill the Christians.

The governor having been informed of all this, summoned all the chiefs,
and warned them in the name of His Majesty to keep the peace, since he
and the Christians had treated them as friends, and were doing them no
injury. He reminded them of the presents he had given them, and of his
promise to defend and protect them from their enemies; but if they
behaved otherwise he would treat them as enemies, and make war upon
them. These threats were made in the presence of the clergy and
officers; he then distributed coloured caps among them, besides other
things. They promised once more to keep friends with the Christians,
and drive away the Guaxarapos and other tribes who came up against the
Christians.

Two days after his arrival at Los Reyes, the governor finding that with
so many Spaniards and Indians collected together he might run short of
provisions, and having no other store except what was contained in the
brigantines moored in the river, and this would only last ten or twelve
days, for the Spaniards and Indians together numbered about three
thousand, seeing their necessities and the danger of their all being
starved, sent all the interpreters to the neighbouring villages to
buy provisions in exchange for merchandise, which he gave them in
considerable quantities. They went, but found no provisions. Having
seen this, the governor sent for the chief Indians of that land,
and asked them where he could buy provisions in exchange for his
merchandise. They answered that at nine leagues distance, on the
shores of certain large lagoons, there lived a people called
Arianicosies, who possessed an abundance of provisions, and would
supply what was necessary.




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SEVENTH.

    _How the governor sent Captain Mendoza in search of provisions._


AS soon as the governor had received this information he convoked
a meeting of officers, clergy, and captains, and other experienced
persons, to concert measures with them, for all the people were crying
for food, and he had none to give them. They were about to disband,
and go into the interior in search of provisions. The officers and the
clergy being assembled, Cabeza de Vaca told them that the danger of
famine was so urgent that all might die if a remedy were not found. He
added that he had been informed that the Arianicosies had provisions,
and he asked them to advise him what should be done. They all answered
that he should send the greater part of the people to the villages of
those Indians, both to sustain themselves and obtain provisions to send
to the people that remained in the port with him. Should they decline to
supply food for payment, force should be resorted to, and, in case of
resistance, they should make war till they obtained what they required,
seeing that the necessities were so urgent that the people were dying
with hunger, and any measures would be excusable. This was their advice,
and they signed their names to it. It was accordingly resolved to
send this captain in search of provisions, charged with the following
instructions:

"Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza, this is what you have to do in the villages
where you have to search for provisions, in order that our people may
not die from starvation. You shall pay for these provisions to the full
satisfaction of Socorinos and Socosies, as well as all those settled in
the province, and you shall say in my name that I am surprised they have
not been to see me, as the other tribes of the province have done; that
I am informed they are good people, and for this reason I wish to
see and receive them into my friendship. You shall give them of my
merchandise, and tell them to come and acknowledge the supremacy of the
king, as all the other Indians have done. If they obey these orders,
I will always favour and protect them against those who would do them
wrong. You shall use the utmost diligence and care that, in all places
you may pass through inhabited by friendly Indians, none of your men
should use violence, or maltreat the natives. All that you take, and all
that they give you, must be paid for to their satisfaction, and leave no
cause of complaint. When you arrive at the villages you shall ask for
the commodities you require for the sustenance of your men, offering
payment, and entreating the Indians with kind words. Should they decline
to provide you with what you want, you shall repeat your request twice,
thrice, or as often as you think right, offering payment beforehand.
Should they then refuse to give it, you shall take it by force, and, if
resistance be offered you, shall make war upon them, for the hunger we
suffer from justifies us in resorting to these extreme measures. In all
that may happen afterwards you shall use such moderation as becomes the
service of God and His Majesty."




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-EIGHTH.

    _How he sent a brigantine to discover the river of the Xarayes with
    Captain de Ribera._


THE governor having sent Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza in conformity with
the advice of the clergy, officers, and captains, this officer departed
on the 15th December, the same year, with 120 Spaniards and 600 Indian
archers, a number more than sufficient for the purpose. The natives of
the port of Los Reyes informed the governor that owing to the rising of
the waters the river Yguatú might be ascended in brigantines as far as
the land of the Xarayes; they told him that these Xarayes, and other
tribes inhabiting the banks of that river, had a quantity of provisions,
and that there were other navigable rivers flowing from the interior,
and discharging into the Yguatú, where there were large settlements of
Indians, who had abundance of food. Desirous of exploring the unknown
parts of this river, the governor sent Captain Hernando de Ribera in a
brigantine with fifty-two men. They had orders to ascend the river to
the villages of the Xarayes, to speak with the chief of this tribe,
and obtain information about the more distant villages, passing on and
seeing them with their own eyes. Neither the commander nor any of his
men were to land, but the interpreter with two men might endeavour to
see and barter with the Indians along the course of the river, giving
presents, and making them proposals of peace. For this purpose the
governor furnished the commander with instructions, and informed him by
word of mouth of everything that he should do for the service of His
Majesty and the good of the country. Hernando de Ribera set sail on the
20th December of the said year.

A few days after his departure Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza wrote to say
that on his arrival at the villages of the Arianicosies he had sent
an interpreter to inform them that he had come to ask them to sell
provisions, which he would pay for with merchandise, such as beads,
knives, iron wedges, which they esteem highly, and that he would give
them a large number of fish-hooks. The interpreter took these articles
with him in order that they might see and understand that they had not
come to do them wrong, or take anything away by force; but that the
interpreter had fled back, for that the natives had tried to kill him,
and shot several arrows at him, saying that they would not allow any
Christians in their land, and would not give them anything, but would
rather kill them all, and that the Guaxarapos, who were brave warriors,
had come to help them. These last-named Indians, they added, have killed
Christians, and found their heads soft, and that they are not a strong
people. The letter went on to say that Gonzalo de Mendoza had sent
a second time the same interpreter to beg them to supply him with
provisions. He had sent with him some Spaniards to see what passed. All
these returned, being pursued by Indians, who had come out with arms to
kill them, and had shot a number of arrows at them, shouting to them to
leave the country, as they would not give them provisions. The captain
having seen all this, had gone with all his troop to bring about their
submission; on arriving at their village all the Indians had come out
against him, and shot arrows at them, intending to kill the Spaniards,
declining to listen to him or let him speak. They had consequently, in
their own defence, killed two of the natives with their arquebuses.
As soon as the enemy saw them dead, they fled into the forest. The
Spaniards then went into their houses, and found an abundance of
provisions, such as maize, mandubies and other plants, roots, and
other comestibles.

Without loss of time, Gonzalo de Mendoza sent an Indian to tell the
natives to return to their homes, promising to be friendly with them,
and to pay for the provisions he had taken. They had refused, however,
to accept his peaceful overtures, had recommenced hostilities,
established their camp, fortified their houses, and had even burned a
great number of these. They had appealed to many other tribes to come
and help them to kill the Christians, and did not desist from doing them
all the harm they could. The governor sent orders to the captain to do
everything in his power to induce the Indians to return; he enjoined him
not to let any of his men do the least harm to the natives, to pay for
all the provisions he had taken, to pacify them, and go elsewhere in
search of provisions. The captain soon afterwards reported that he had
persuaded the Indians to return, had offered them his friendship, and,
far from injuring them, would treat them kindly; they had, however,
declined his advances, and were continuing hostilities in conjunction
with the Guaxarapos, Guatos, and other of our enemies who were in league
with them.




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-NINTH.

    _How Captain Francisco de Ribera returned from his exploration._


ON the 20th January 1544, Captain Francisco de Ribera returned,
accompanied by the six Spaniards whom the governor had sent with him,
with the guide and three Guaranís, being all that were left of the
eleven Guaranís who had formed part of his expedition. He had been sent,
as I have already said, to discover and observe with his own eyes the
villages situated in that part where the governor was obliged to turn
back. They had advanced towards Tapuaguazú, where the guide had stated
the Indian settlements began. On the arrival of the six Spaniards, all
of whom were wounded, the people rejoiced greatly and gave thanks to God
for their escape from such a perilous journey, for, indeed, the governor
thought they were lost, because eight of the eleven Indians that started
with them had abandoned them. He was very angry with these men and
wished to punish them, and the chiefs, their relatives, begged that they
might be hanged for having deserted the Christians, though they had been
ordered not to leave them, and to escort them till they returned. These
chiefs said that since they had failed to do this they deserved hanging,
but as it was the first time they had disobeyed he pardoned them,
fearing to excite their tribesmen.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTIETH.

    _How Captain Francisco de Ribera reported of his discovery._


THE following day Captain Francisco de Ribera appeared before the
governor with the six other Spaniards who had accompanied him. He gave
an account of his exploration, and said: that after he left him in the
forest he marched, following the guide for twenty-one days, without
resting, through a country so thickly covered with trees and brushwood
that it was impossible to advance without cutting a path. Some days they
went one league, on others only half a league in two days, owing to the
obstacles they encountered, the dense forests, and projecting rocks. The
direction they followed was continually west; all the time they marched
they sustained themselves on venison, wild boars' flesh, and tapirs,
which the Indians killed with their arrows; game was so abundant that
they knocked down with sticks all they required for food. They found
a great supply of honey in cavities of trees, and quantities of wild
fruit. After twenty-one days they arrived at a river running to the
west, and this river, according to their guide, flowed past Tapuaguazú
and the Indian settlements. They caught much fish in it of a kind called
by the natives _piraputanas_, which are a kind of _sabalos_,[356] and
are excellent. The Spaniards crossed this river, and, following their
guide, came upon the fresh tracks of Indians; for it had been raining
that day, and the ground was moist. It was evident that the Indians were
a party of hunters. Following their footprints, they came upon two
large stacks of maize which was then being harvested. At this moment
an Indian, who had not time to conceal himself, came towards them. He
spoke a language they could not understand, wore a large silver disc in
his lower lip, and gold earrings. He took Francisco de Ribera by the
hand and signed to him to accompany him, which he did. They now observed
a large house made of straw and wood. On approaching it, they saw women
and other Indians carrying out of the house cotton stuffs and other
articles, which they placed in front of the stacks. The Indian made them
enter the house, where men and women were carrying out all it contained.
In order to avoid passing the Christians, they made an opening in the
straw, and passed the things out that way. Our people saw them taking
from some large vessels full of maize, plates, hatchets, and bracelets
of silver which they carried outside the straw walls. This Indian
appeared to be the head of the family from the respect shown him. He
took them inside, and signed to them to be seated, and ordered two
_Orejones_ (Indians with large ears), whom they supposed to be his
slaves, to give them maize wine to drink out of some jars, which stood
in the house buried up to their necks in the earth. They poured the wine
into large gourds, and handed these to the Spaniards. The two Orejones
said that at three days' journey from that place there were Christians
living with a tribe called Payzunoes; they then told the way to
Tapuaguazú, which is a high mountain. Soon many natives arrived in their
war-paint and feathers, with bows and arrows. The Indian spoke very
volubly to them, and he also took a bow and arrows; he sent men, who
came and went, with messages, by which the Spaniards knew that he was
summoning the population from the neighbouring villages, and intended
killing them. The captain told the Christians who were with him to come
out of the house altogether, and return by the way they came, before
more Indians had assembled; by this time there were over three hundred.
Ribera gave the natives to understand that he would go and fetch many
other Christians who were close at hand, and, as they were expecting
more to arrive, they had only to wait till he came back. By this ruse
our people escaped, but, at a stone's throw from the house, the Indians,
who saw they were escaping, pursued them with cries, and shot many
arrows at them. They followed them into the forest, where the Christians
defended themselves, and the Indians, thinking there were a larger
number of them here, durst not pursue further, but let them go; all the
Spaniards, however, were wounded. They came back the way they went, and
it took them only twelve days to return to the place where they had left
the governor, whence they had marched in twenty-one days. The captain
estimated the distance from the Port of Los Reyes to the villages of
those Indians at seventy leagues.

  [356] Shad.

A lagoon twenty leagues from this port, in crossing which they had the
water knee-deep, was, upon their return, so greatly increased that it
covered a league of land, and was two pikes deep. They crossed it in
rafts with great danger and difficulty. The captain added that, before
attempting to enter that country, it would be necessary to wait till the
waters subsided. The Indians he had seen were called _Tarapecosies_;
they have plenty of provisions, and they rear geese and poultry like
ours. This was the account given by Francisco de Ribera and by the
Spaniards who accompanied him, and by the guide, all of whom confirmed
what Francisco de Ribera had said.

There were some Indians in the port of Los Reyes belonging to the same
tribe of Tarapecosies, from whose village de Ribera had just returned.
They had come with Garcia, the interpreter, when he made his journey
into the interior and returned defeated by the Guaranís of the Paraguai.
These Indians had escaped with the Chaneses, who had also fled and lived
all together in the port of Los Reyes. The governor, wishing for further
information, sent for them. They immediately recognised the arrows that
Francisco de Ribera had brought with him, which had been shot at him by
the Tarapecosies, as those used in their native country. The governor
asked them why their fellow-tribesmen had wished to kill those who had
gone to see them. They answered that the Tarapecosies were no enemies of
the Christians; on the contrary, they were their friends since Garcia
had visited their country and trafficked with them. The reason why they
had tried to kill the Spaniards was because these had taken Guaranís
with them whom they regarded as enemies; for in former times these
people had invaded their territory and sought to destroy them. The
Christians, they said, should have taken an interpreter with them who
knew their language, to let them know the object of their visit, for
they were not in the habit of making war upon those who did them no
injury. If they take an interpreter, they added, they will be well
treated and supplied with provisions, and gold and silver, which are
obtained from the tribes of the interior. Asked from what tribe and how
they acquired their gold and silver, they answered that the Payzunos,
who lived three days' journey off, gave them these precious metals in
exchange for bows and arrows and slaves, which they took from other
tribes; the Payzunos obtained them from the Chaneses, Chimenos,
Carcaraes, Candirées, and other Indian nations who possess an abundance
of them. They were shown a brass candlestick very bright and shiny, to
see if the gold they had in their land was like that. They said that the
metal of the candlestick was hard and base, but their metal was soft and
without smell, and more yellow. Then they were shown a gold ring, and
asked if that were the metal of their country, and they said it was.
They were also shown a tin plate, very bright and shiny, and asked if
the silver in their country was of that kind. They answered that this
metal stank, and was base and soft; theirs was whiter, harder, and had
no bad smell. A silver cup was then put in their hands, and they were
greatly pleased with it, and said that of that metal they had quantities
in their land in the form of small vases and other things in use among
the Indians, such as plates, bracelets, crowns, small hatchets, and
other objects.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FIRST.

    _How the governor sent for Gonzalo de Mendoza._


THE governor, in order to provide what was necessary for the exploration
of this country as it beseemed the service of His Majesty, sent, without
delay, for Gonzalo de Mendoza to recall him and his men from the land
of the Arianicosies. Before leaving their village, however, he was to
endeavour to get the Indians to return to their houses and pacify them.

Soon after the arrival of Francisco de Ribera and his six Spaniards at
the port of Los Reyes, all the people there began to suffer from fevers,
so that there were not sufficient men to mount guard in camp. Even the
Guaranís were sick of this malady, and several died.

Gonzalo de Mendoza wrote that all his people were also ill of the fever,
and that he was sending in the brigantines all the sick and infirm. He
had not been able to make peace with the Arianicosies, though he had
several times made friendly overtures and offered them presents. Yet
in spite of this they came every day and attacked him. The country, he
said, abounded in provisions, both in the fields and lakes. Besides the
provisions he had sent in the brigantines, a large quantity was left
for the natives. The sickness that had attacked all the people was
attributable to the pollution of the water, which had become brackish
as it rose.

About this time the Indians living in an island about one league from
port Los Reyes, who are called Socorinos and Xaqueses, seeing how sick
and weak the Christians were, began to make war upon them. They no
longer came to traffic and barter with the Christians as they had
hitherto done, nor informed them of the evil designs of the Guaxarapos;
they even joined these latter, and prepared for a campaign against the
Spaniards. The Indian Guaranís whom the Spaniards had brought in their
armada were in the habit of going out in their canoes, in company with
some Christians, to fish in the lagoon, a stone's-throw from the camp.
One morning five Christians, four of whom were boys, had gone in the
canoes with these Guaranís, when the Xaqueses, Socorinos, and many other
Indians of that island, came out and captured the five Christians,
killed the newly-converted among the Guaranís, and brought the rest
to their island, where they hacked the five Christians in pieces and
distributed them among the Guaxarapos, Guatos, and other natives of
the environs of port _Viejo_ (the ancient). Other tribes, who were
associated with them for the purpose of making war upon the Christians,
had their share of the flesh of these unfortunate people. Not content
with this, as the people were ill and weak, they came with great daring
to attack the settlement where the Christians were, and set fire to
it. These shouted, "To arms, to arms, the Indians are killing the
Christians." As the whole settlement was now under arms, they went out
to meet the Indians, who, nevertheless, succeeded in capturing more
Christians, and among them one called Pedro Mepen, and some others who
were fishing in the lagoon, and ate these as they had done the first
five.

The following morning at daybreak a large number of canoes were seen
filled by warriors, who were running away to the opposite side of the
lagoon; they uttered loud cries, pointed their bows and arrows, and
held them up to make us understand that they had made the assault. They
penetrated into the island situated in the lagoon of Los Reyes, and
killed this time fifty-eight Christians. The governor having witnessed
this disaster, told the natives of the port of Los Reyes to demand
from the Indians of the island the release of the Christians they had
captured. These people having gone and demanded their release, were told
that the Guaxarapos had taken the prisoners away. From that time they
continually came at night, made incursions on the lagoon to see if they
might capture any Christians or Indians fishing there, so as to prevent
their fishing; for they declared the land was theirs and that the
Christians had no right to fish there; that we must leave the country,
otherwise they would kill us. The governor sent to try and appease
them, and to tell them to keep the peace they had made, and restore the
Christian and Indian captives they had taken, promising in such case to
treat them as friends, but that if they refused, he would act against
them as enemies. He repeated this message several times, but they would
not submit, and did not cease hostilities, and doing us all the mischief
they could. Seeing these measures were of no avail, the governor
ordered that an inquiry should be held, and when this had been done in
accordance with the advice of the officers and clergy, these people were
proclaimed enemies, war was declared against them, and the country was
protected from the ravages daily committed.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SECOND.

    _How Hernando de Ribera returned from his exploration along the
    river._


ON the 30th January 1543, Captain Hernando de Ribera returned with
the vessel and men entrusted to him for the exploration of the higher
reaches of the river. But when he returned he found the governor and all
his people sick with fever and shivering fits, so he could not make his
report.[357] By that time the water in the river had so swollen that all
the land was inundated, and it was impossible to renew the exploration.
The natives say that the floods continue for four months, and rise five
or six fathoms, and that they then enter their canoes with their houses
and provisions, as I have related above, and are not able to land.
The natives of this country kill and eat one another. When the waters
subside they set up their houses again on shore in the same places as
before. The land is about this time infected with malaria, arising from
the putrefaction of fish, which are left in large numbers on the dry
land, and with the high temperature then prevailing it is impossible to
endure the stench.

  [357] This report will be found at the end of the Commentaries.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-THIRD.

    _What befell the governor and his people in the port of Los Reyes._


THE governor remained three months in this port of Los Reyes with all
his people ill with fever, waiting till God should be pleased to
restore them to health, and the waters should subside to enable them to
undertake the exploration of the country. But every day the sickness
increased and the waters rose. We were, therefore, obliged to withdraw
from the port of Los Reyes in great trouble. Besides the illness by
which we were attacked, there were so many mosquitoes of various kinds
that we could neither sleep nor rest day and night; the sufferings we
endured from this plague were even worse than the fever. Because of
these inconveniences, and as the officers had requested him to abandon
the port and to return to the city of Ascension, where the people could
recover, the governor having referred to the clergy and officers,
decided on withdrawing. Yet he would not allow the Christians to take
with them about a hundred girls, whom the natives of Los Reyes, upon
the governor's arrival, had offered to the captains and officers of
distinction, so as to be on good terms with them, leaving them to do
what they pleased with the girls. The motive of this refusal was to
avoid the offence against God done in this way. He ordered, at the
moment of departure, the fathers of these girls to receive them back
into their houses till our return, being unwilling that their parents
should be dissatisfied and the country scandalised because of this. To
give more importance to this action of his, he published a rescript
of His Majesty, forbidding, under the severest penalty, anybody from
removing natives from their homes. The natives were well satisfied with
this measure, but the Spaniards were greatly discontented, some of them
felt ill-disposed towards him, and from that time he was detested by the
majority. This was the motive or pretext for their subsequent conduct,
as I shall relate further on. All the people, Christians and Indians,
having embarked, he came in twelve days to the port of Ascension, though
it had taken two months to ascend the same way. Though sick to death,
the people derived strength from their desire to return home. The perils
and difficulties of this voyage were certainly not light, for the men
were not strong enough to handle their arms to resist the enemy, or make
use of an oar to help to steer the vessels; and had it not been for the
culverins we carried, our trouble would have been greater. We drew the
canoes of the Indians into the midst of the brigantines to protect them
from the enemy's attacks till we came to their homes, and for better
security the governor distributed some Christians in the canoes.

We took every precaution, and kept a sharp look-out for the enemy, when,
as we were passing the lands of the Guaxarapos, these natives attacked
us suddenly with a number of canoes. They assailed some rafts that were
being taken in reserve, and wounded a Christian with a dart, which
pierced him in the breast, so that he fell dead on the spot. His name
was Miranda, and he came from Valladolid. They also wounded some of our
Indians, and would have caused us more losses had it not been for our
culverins. The weakness of the soldiers was the cause of it.

On the 8th April of the same year we arrived at the town of Ascension
with our troops, our Guaranís, and our vessels. The Governor and the
Christians that were with him were all sick and weak. On his arrival,
Captain Salazar told him that he had assembled over 20,000 Indians and
a large number of canoes to go out against the Agaces, for, since the
departure of the governor, they had not ceased making war upon the
Christians and the natives, plundering and slaying them, taking from
them wives and children, burning villages and committing every kind of
excess. When the governor arrived, the expedition to punish the Agaces
had not yet started. We found the caravel ordered by the governor nearly
finished. He had intended sending it, as soon as it was ready, to bear
information to His Majesty of all that had happened in his voyage of
discovery and all that had passed in the country. Orders were now given
to complete the caravel.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FOURTH.

    _How the governor, having arrived with his people at the town of
    Ascension, was made a prisoner._


FIFTEEN days after the arrival of the governor at Ascension, the
officers of His Majesty, who hated him because he refused to consent to
things done against the service of God and the king, seeing him arrive
with the other Christians in this extremity, conspired with their
friends on St. Mark's Day to take him prisoner that night. They had
already depopulated the best and principal port of the province, with
the intention of rebelling against the sovereign, as they have now done.
In order to carry out their plans in the most effective way, they told
a hundred men that they knew the governor was about to take from
them their property, their houses, and their Indian girls, and would
distribute these among the men who had returned from the exploring
expedition; that it was a great injustice and contrary to the service of
His Majesty. "This night", they added, "we will go and require him, in
the name of the king, not to take away your houses, nor your lands, nor
your Indian girls, and, as we fear the governor may have us arrested,
arm yourselves and bring your friends, for you will be doing a great
service to His Majesty in this way." It was arranged that at the Ave
Maria these men should come armed to two houses which would be assigned
to them, and should hold themselves in readiness there for further
orders. So the insurgents, ten or twelve in number, entered the
apartment where the governor was lying on his bed of sickness, with
cries of "Liberty, liberty, long live the king!" They were the
supervisor Alonso Cabrera, the accountant Philip de Caceres, Garcia
Vanegas, acting treasurer, a servant of the governor named Pedro
de Onate (who was in the room with him, opened the door to the
conspirators, and was an active promoter of the insurrection), Don
Francisco de Mendoza, Jaime Rasquin (who held an arquebus and a poisoned
dart at his breast), Diego de Acosta, Portuguese interpreter, and
Solorzano, a native of Canaria. These men entered with arms in their
hands and seized the governor, dragged him out of the room in his
shirt, continuing to cry: "Liberty, liberty!" They called him a tyrant,
levelled their arquebuses at him, saying such words as these: "Now you
shall pay the penalty of your offences and the losses you have caused
us." When they had come out into the street they were joined by others
whom they had enlisted on their side, who, seeing they were carrying the
governor off a prisoner in that fashion, said to Pedro Dorantes and the
others: "Let the responsibility of this rest with the traitors who did
the deed; you brought us here on the pretext that our goods, houses, and
Indian girls would be taken from us, but your real object was to make
us parties to your treason against the king"; upon this they drew their
swords, and there was a serious scrimmage. As the insurgents were now
approaching the houses of the officers some took refuge in the house of
Garcia Vanegas, dragging the governor along with them. Others remained
at the door, saying to those who had taken the part of the governor:
"You are betraying us; don't say that you did not know what was going to
be done; help us to put him into prison. If you attempt to deliver him
we will cut you to pieces and chop off your heads. It is a matter of
life and death to you; aid us, therefore, to complete what we have
begun, and we will all share the goods, the Indian girls, and furniture
of the governor." The officers then entered the small room in which the
governor was confined, placed him in irons, and set a watch upon him.
Having done this they repaired to the house of Juan Pavon, alcalde
mayor, and to that of the alguazil, Francisco de Peralta. When they
had come to the alcalde mayor's, Martin de Ure, a Biscayan, as
leader, seized by force the staff of office. They did the same at the
alguazil's, and, having struck these functionaries several blows with
the fist and knocked them about, they called them traitors and took them
to the public prison, where they were put in the stocks by the head.
They set at liberty the prisoners, among whom was one sentenced to death
for having murdered a certain Morales, a gentleman of Seville. Having
done this, they took a drum and marched about the streets, exciting the
people to rebel, and uttering loud cries of "Liberty, liberty! Long live
the king!"

After they had made the circuit of the city in this way, the same
individuals went to the house of Pero Hernandez, secretary of the
province, who was ill at the time. They arrested him, as well as
Bartolomé Gonzales, took possession of his property and documents, and
carried him prisoner to the house of Domingo de Irala, where they placed
him in chains, and, after insulting him, left him in the hands of the
sentinels. Then they published the following proclamation: "The officers
of His Majesty prohibit all persons from appearing in the streets;
anyone going out of doors will be considered a traitor and condemned to
death." Having done this they again shouted, "Liberty, liberty!" While
posting this order, they pushed and hustled everyone they met in the
streets, forcing people to enter their houses.

They then went to the house of the governor, where he kept his property,
papers, and the letters he had received from the king appointing him
governor of the province, as well as the acts by which his authority
had been recognised. They forced open some chests, extracted all the
documents contained in them, and took possession of everything. They
also opened a chest, locked with three keys, containing the public
indictments against officers charged with crimes referred to the king
for final sentence. They took also his goods, stuffs, provisions, oil,
steel, and iron, besides a number of other things. Most of these things
disappeared, everything being looted. They denounced him as a tyrant,
and abused him in every way. The remainder of his property was bestowed
upon such as professed to be attached to him, who took them under
pretext of deposit; but these so-called friends of the deposed governor
really helped the insurgents. His property was said to be worth over
100,000 castellanos,[358] according to the value current then; he had
also ten brigantines.

  [358] A gold coin formerly in use in Spain. During the reign of the
  Catholic kings it was worth 490 maravedis of silver, equal to about
  4_s._ 9_d._ The value of these coins afterwards fluctuated. This sum
  is undoubtedly grossly exaggerated.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FIFTH.

    _How the population assembled before the house of Domingo de Irala._


THE following day the officers published in the streets, by sound of
drum and trumpet, that all the people should assemble in front of the
house of Captain Domingo de Irala. Their friends and partisans having
gone there armed, a libel was read by the public crier in a loud voice.
It stated that the governor had ordered them all to be deprived of their
possessions and to be treated as slaves: and that they, in the general
interests of liberty, had laid hands on his person. When this libel had
been read they called out, "Sirs, cry, Liberty, liberty, long live the
king!" And this was accordingly done by their friends. After these
proceedings they inveighed against the governor, and many said, "Come
what may, let us kill this tyrant who wished to ruin and destroy us."

When the fury of the population had somewhat calmed down, they elected
Domingo de Irala as deputy-governor and captain general of the whole
province. This man had already been elected once before in the place of
Francisco Ruiz, once Don Pedro de Mendoza's deputy. Ruiz had been in
truth a good deputy-governor; but against all justice, and from envy
and malice, he was deposed and Domingo de Irala elected in his stead.
Someone having said to the supervisor, Alonso Cabrera, that they had
acted badly in that case, because Francisco Ruiz had colonized the
country and been at great pains to maintain it, he answered that they
had acted thus because Ruiz would not do what they wished, but that
Domingo de Irala, whose rank was less than their own, would always do
what they bade him; and for this reason all the officers elected him.
They appointed Pero Diaz del Valle alcalde mayor, because he was a
friend of Domingo de Irala, and gave the insignia of alguazil to a
certain Bartolomé de la Marilla, a native of Truxillo, a friend of Nuflo
de Chaves, and to Sancho de Salinas, a native of Cazalla.

Then the officers and Domingo de Irala made it known that they intended
fitting out a new expedition to the country discovered by the governor,
to search for gold and silver, and sending it, when found, to His
Majesty, in order that they might be pardoned the crime they had
committed. Should they not succeed in finding gold, they would not
return, as they feared punishment; yet it might happen that they found
so much of the precious metal that the king, in return for it, would
make them a present of the country. By such means as these they cajoled
the people. However, everybody knew enough of their misdeeds and
their past and present conduct to decline consenting to the proposed
expedition. And since then the majority of the people began to
remonstrate against the imprisonment of the governor. Then the officers
and newly-appointed magistrates began to maltreat those who showed
discontent at the governor's imprisonment. They imprisoned them,
deprived them of all their possessions, and tormented them in every way.
When these people took refuge in the church, in order to avoid being
arrested, they stationed watchmen at the door, so that no provisions
might reach them. They punished those who attempted to relieve them,
disarmed all the inhabitants and harassed them by every means in their
power. They, moreover, said in public that they would kill any persons
who might show discontent at the governor's imprisonment.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SIXTH.

    _Of the tumults and disturbances that took place in the country._


FROM that time tumults and dissensions frequently arose among the
people. Those that were of the party of the king denounced the
rebel officers and their partisans as traitors. These, fearing the
inhabitants, went armed day and night; they built stockades and other
works for their defence, barricaded the streets, and withdrew into five
or six houses. The governor was confined in a small room in the house
of Garcia Vanegas, so as to have him in their midst. The alcalde and
alguazils daily searched the houses immediately surrounding that in
which the governor was held a captive, for fear lest an attempt might be
made to enter them by means of mines. When the officers saw two or three
men of the governor's party talking together, they would immediately
raise the alarm, enter the place in which governor Nunez was confined,
lay their hands on their daggers, and swear that if an attempt were made
to rescue him they would cut off his head and throw it to his would-be
deliverers. They appointed four men, whom they considered the bravest of
their band, to stand ready armed with poniards, and made them swear that
on the first attempt to rescue him in the name of His Majesty they would
immediately enter and behead him. These men were posted so near the
governor that he could hear them talking and sharpening their daggers.
These executioners were Garcia Vanegas, Andres Hernandez, _el romo_,
besides others.

Not only was the arrest of the governor the cause of general tumult
and dissension, there were also many private disputes and lawsuits
in consequence of the edicts which had followed. Some said that the
officers and their friends were traitors, and had done wrong in
arresting Alvar Nunez; that they had caused the ruin of the country as
then appeared, and even now appears to be the case. Others took the
contrary view; and they killed, wounded, and maimed one another. The
officers and their friends said that the partisans of the governor
and those who wished him set at liberty were traitors, and should be
punished as such; they forbade suspected persons from talking together.
Whenever they saw two men together in the streets they drew out an act
of inquest, and arrested them in order to know what they were saying;
and if three or four collected together, they fell upon them with their
weapons. They had placed sentries on the roof of the house in which the
governor was confined, in two sentry-boxes, that they might overlook the
whole town and adjacent country. Their spies, too, reported what was
being done and said in the town. At night, thirty armed men patrolled
the streets, arresting anybody they met, demanding to know whither
they were going, and for what purpose. As the tumults and disorders
increased, the officers and their partisans became harassed, and begged
the governor to give an order to the people to keep the peace and not
revolt; and if necessary to fix a penalty for disobedience to this
order. The officers drafted this order for him to sign, but when he had
signed it they were advised not to publish it, because they pretended
that everybody had been in favour of his arrest. For this reason the
order was not published.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SEVENTH.

    _How the governor was kept in prison._


WHILE these events were happening the governor was very ill in bed,
and for the sake of his health chains were fastened round his feet;
by his pillow a candle burned, for the prison was dark, no light being
admitted, and so damp that the grass grew under his bed; he had the
candle because he might want it at any moment. To crown his miseries,
they had searched among the whole population for the man most evilly
disposed towards him, and they found one named Hernando de Sosa, whom
the governor had punished for striking an Indian chief. This man was
placed on guard in the same room with him. The prison closed with two
sliding doors furnished with padlocks; the officers and their partisans
watched him day and night armed to the teeth; and there were upwards of
one hundred and fifty of them, all paid with his property.

Notwithstanding this strict watch kept upon him, every night, or every
third night, an Indian woman who brought him his supper conveyed him a
letter written by one of his friends, informing him of all that happened
outside his prison. They begged him to say what he wished them to do,
three parts of the people being determined to die with the Indians in
order to deliver him. They had feared to do this because of the threats
of the officers to kill him should an attempt at a rescue be made.
Seventy of those guarding him were ready to join them and make
themselves masters of the principal entrance of the prison. They
promised to defend him till the arrival of his friends. The governor
opposed this project, because it could not easily be accomplished
without the slaughter of a large number of Christians. Besides, when
once the scheme had been put into execution, the Indians would have
put an end to the Christians and brought about the final ruin of the
country. For these reasons he dissuaded them from their purpose.

The Indian woman who brought him a letter every third night, and took
back an answer, passed through the midst of the guards, who stripped her
naked, examined her mouth and ears, and cut off her hair, for fear of
her concealing anything. They even searched her in parts which modesty
compels me not to mention. This woman, as I have stated, passed the
guard quite naked, and having come to where the governor was, handed the
gaoler what she brought, and then sat down on his bed, for the room was
small. She then began to scratch her foot, and while engaged in this
way, drew forth a letter which she handed to the governor behind the
back of the gaoler. This letter, written on very thin paper, was deftly
rolled up and covered with black wax; this was concealed under the
lesser toes, and attached to these by two black threads. In this way she
brought the letters and the necessary paper for him to write his answer,
and a little powder made of a certain black stone of the country, which,
moistened with a little saliva or water, made ink. The officers and
their friends suspected her, for they had learned that the governor knew
what was passing outside the prison, and what they were doing. In order
to be sure of this, they chose four of the more youthful of their party
to seduce the Indian woman--not a difficult task, for these women are
not sparing of their charms, and consider it an affront to deny their
favours to anyone; they say, moreover, that they have received them for
that purpose. These four youths accordingly intrigued with her and gave
her many presents; but they could never make her divulge her secret
during the whole of their intercourse, which lasted eleven months.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-EIGHTH.

    _How the insurgents ravaged the land and took possession of the
    property of the inhabitants._


WHILE the governor was in this situation, the officers and Domingo de
Irala gave public permission to all their friends and partisans to go
into the villages and huts of the Indians and take by force their wives,
daughters, hammocks, and other of their possessions, a thing contrary to
the service of His Majesty and the peace of the country. While this was
going on they would scour the country, strike the Indians blows with
sticks, carry them off to their houses, and oblige them to labour
in their fields without any remuneration. When the Indians came and
complained to Domingo de Irala and the officers, these answered that
it was no affair of theirs, which pleased the Christians, because they
knew that this answer was given to suit their pleasure and secure their
support, for they might say that they had full liberty to do what
they liked. These replies and bad treatment caused the country to
be deserted. The natives withdrew to the mountains, and concealed
themselves in places where the Christians could not find them. A large
number were Christians, together with wives and children. When they left
the settlement they lost the religious teaching of the monks and clergy,
the governor having paid great attention to their religious instruction.
A few days after his arrest they destroyed the caravel which he had made
to send advice to His Majesty of all that was passing in the province;
for the insurgents hoped to get the people to undertake a voyage of
discovery in that country, where the governor had already partly
explored; they thought they might obtain gold and silver there, and that
they would have the honour of rendering important service to the king.

There being no justice in the land, the inhabitants and colonists
suffered many wrongs from the officers and magistrates appointed by the
insurgents. They were imprisoned and deprived of their property; at
least fifty of them became so indignant that they retreated into the
interior towards the coast of Brazil, with the intention of finding
means of proceeding to Spain and informing His Majesty of all the
wrongs, misdeeds, and disturbances passing in the land. Many others
were overtaken and kept in prison a long time; their arms and all their
possessions were taken away and distributed among their friends and
partisans, in order to engage their support for the party in power.




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-NINTH.

    _How the monks left the country._


WHILE this sad state of things was going on without hope of remedy, the
monks--friar Bernardo de Armenta[359] thinking the moment opportune for
putting into execution their long-conceived project of departing (having
already attempted it, as I have said before), spoke about it to the
officers and to Domingo de Irala, in order that they should give them
permission and the necessary help to reach the coast of Brazil. These
officers consented, in order to give them satisfaction because they
had opposed the governor, who had hindered their taking the route they
wished. Permission was accordingly granted to them, and the necessary
help to go to Brazil. They took with them some Spaniards and Indian
women, to whom they were teaching Christianity.

  [359] The name of the other monk is omitted in the text. It was
  probably Alonzo Lebron; cf. _supra_, pp. 100, 136.

During his captivity the governor had asked the insurgents several times
to let him appoint a deputy to rule the province in the name of His
Majesty, in order to terminate the tumults and disorders that were of
such constant occurrence, and restore justice and tranquillity in the
land. After making this nomination he would have liked to go before
the king and render an account of all that had passed, and the actual
position of affairs. The officers answered, however, that by his arrest
his authority had lost all its force, and that the person they had
nominated as governor would serve the purpose. Every day they entered
his prison and threatened to put an end to his life. The governor
replied that, should they decide upon doing this, he begged, and even if
necessary he required, them in God's name and the king's to send him a
clergyman to confess him. They said that if they gave him a confessor
it would be Francisco de Andrada, or another native of Biscay (who were
concerned in the insurrection), and if he would have neither of them, he
should have none at all, because the others were their enemies and his
supporters. In fact, they had arrested Antonio d'Escalera, Rodrigo de
Herrera, and Luis de Miranda, because they had said, and were still
saying, that the arrest of the governor was a great sin, and contrary to
the service of God and His Majesty, and would bring ruin upon the land.
The priest, Luis de Miranda, had been imprisoned with the Alcalde mayor
for more than eight months without seeing sun or moon all that time. And
the insurgents would never consent that any other of the clergy except
those we have named should confess him.

A gentleman[360] named Anton Bravo, eighteen years of age, having been
heard to say one day that he would form a scheme to release the governor
from prison, the officers and Domingo de Irala had him arrested,
and applied the torture to him, to find pretext for punishing and
ill-treating others whom they hated. They offered him his liberty if
he would incriminate others whom he had named in his evidence. These
were all taken and disarmed. Anton Bravo was publicly bastinadoed in
the street, proclaimed a traitor, and accused of being unfaithful to
His Majesty by trying to deliver the governor from prison.

  [360] In original, hidalgo, from _hijo de algo_, _i.e._, a person
  of good birth.




CHAPTER THE EIGHTIETH.

    _How they tortured those who were not on their side._


THIS was the cause of many other cruel torturings to find out if the
persons accused had concerted measures for the release of the governor
from prison. They sought to know who were the persons concerned in the
scheme, how he was to be delivered, and if the ground were mined. Many
were deprived of the use of their limbs by these tortures. Inscriptions
having been found on the walls, which said, "Thou shalt die for thy king
and thy law," the officers, Domingo de Irala, and the magistrates, took
steps to find out who were the authors, swearing and threatening to
punish them, and they arrested a number of persons, whom they put to the
torture.




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-FIRST.

    _How they wished to kill a sheriff who had made them a requisition._


AFFAIRS being in the state I have described, a certain Pedro de Molina,
a native of Guadix, and judge of that town, having been witness of
the misfortunes and troubles that were taking place in the country,
determined, in His Majesty's interests, to enter the stockaded enclosure
where Domingo de Irala and his officers were residing, and in the
presence of all, doffing his cap, he asked Martin de Ure, the notary,
to read to the officers a requisition that the evils, murders, and
injustice occasioned by the arrest of the governor might cease. He
demanded that Alvar Nunez should be set free, and that he should be
allowed to invest some fitting person, with his authority, to govern the
province in the name of His Majesty, and maintain peace and justice. The
notary at first refused to read it because the insurgents were present,
but at length he took it, and said to Pedro de Molina that if he wished
it read he must pay him his fee. Pedro de Molina drew his sword and
handed it to him. The notary declined the sword as a pledge for payment.
Then Pedro de Molina took off his woollen hood and gave it to him,
saying: "Read it, I have no better pledge to offer." Martin de Ure took
the hood and the requisition, and threw them both down at his feet,
declaring that he would not notify it to those gentlemen. Thereupon
Garcia Vanegas, the deputy-treasurer, addressed some insulting words to
Pedro de Molina, threatening to have him beaten to death, and that he
deserved it for daring to speak in that way. Pedro de Molina then went
out, raising his cap, considering himself fortunate in escaping without
further ill-treatment.




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-SECOND.

    _How the insurgents gave the Indians permission to eat human flesh._


THE officers and Domingo de Irala, wishing to gain favour among the
natives, gave them permission to kill and eat their Indian enemies.
Many of those who availed themselves of this license were converted
Christians. The insurgents had adopted this expedient, unbecoming to the
service of God and His Majesty, and horrible to all who knew of it, in
order to prevent the Indians from leaving the country, and attaching
them to their party. They told them the governor was a bad man, inasmuch
as he would not authorise their killing and eating their enemies, and
that he had been arrested on that account, and that they now gave them
free permission to do this.

In spite of all their efforts, the officers and Domingo de Irala, seeing
that the tumults and quarrels would not cease, but were daily on the
increase, decided to remove the governor from the province, while those
who took this step chose to remain where they were and not return to
Spain; they only desired to expel him and some of his friends. The
partisans of the governor, on hearing this resolution, were much
excited. They said that since the officers had usurped the power of
deposing the governor and arresting him, and had given their supporters
to understand that they would go with him to Spain, to explain their
conduct to His Majesty, they must keep their promise, and if they all
refused to go, that two, at all events, should accompany him, and that
the other two might remain in the province. So they arranged it in
that way, and, in order to take him to Spain, they equipped one of the
brigantines which he had built for exploring and conquering the country.
This gave rise to serious altercations, owing to the discontent that
prevailed at seeing they were about to take Alvar Nunez from the
province. The officers resolved upon arresting the leaders of the
malcontents, but durst not carry out their intention. In this dilemma
they had again recourse to the governor, conjuring him to put an end to
all the scandals and disorders; that if his friends would give their
word not to attempt his release, that they on their side, and their
magistrates, would promise not to arrest anybody, or do any injury to
anybody, and would set those free whom they had arrested, and they swore
it. As the governor had now been in prison a long time, and nobody had
seen him, it was suspected and feared that they had secretly murdered
him. They were accordingly asked to allow two monks and two gentlemen to
enter his prison and see him, so that they might certify the people he
was still alive. The officers promised they would do this three or four
days before it was time for him to embark, but they broke their word.




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-THIRD.

    _How the insurgents had to write to His Majesty and send him a
    report._


AT this juncture the officers prepared several memoirs to send to Spain,
accusing the governor and making him odious to everybody. To lend a
favourable colour to their own criminal acts, they wrote things that
never happened and were entirely untrue. While the brigantine was being
equipped for her voyage, the friends of the governor arranged with the
carpenters to hollow a timber as big as a man's thigh, and three spans
long, and place inside it a general act of accusation which the governor
had addressed to His Majesty, and other important papers collected by
his friends when he was arrested. This packet was taken and enveloped in
a waxed cloth, and the piece of timber was fastened to the poop of the
brigantine with six nails above and six below. The carpenters said that
they had placed it there to strengthen the brigantine, and the secret
was kept so well that nobody discovered it. The master carpenter told
a sailor of it, so that when the vessel arrived in Spain the documents
might be taken out. It had been arranged with the officers that the
governor should be seen by his friends before he embarked, but neither
Captain Salazar nor anybody saw him. One night, towards midnight, Alonso
Cabrera, the supervisor, and Pedro Dorantes, his factor, accompanied by
a large number of arquebusiers, presented themselves at the prison; and
each arquebusier carried three lighted fuses in his hand, so as to make
the number appear greater than it was. Then Alonso Cabrera and Pedro
Dorantes entered the room in which he lay; they seized him by the arm
and lifted him out of the bed with the chains round his feet; he was
very ill, almost to death. They carried him in this state to the gate
leading into the street, and when he saw the sky, which he had not seen
till then, he entreated them to let him render thanks to God. When he
rose from his knees, two soldiers took him under the arms and carried
him on board the brigantine, for he was extremely weak and crippled.
When he saw himself in the midst of these people, he said to them:
"Sirs, be my witnesses that I appoint, as my deputy, Juan de Salazar de
Espinosa, that he may govern this province instead of me, and in the
name of His Majesty, maintaining order and justice till the King should
have been pleased to make other dispositions." Hardly had he finished
speaking than Garcia Vanegas, deputy treasurer, rushed upon him, dagger
in hand, saying: "I do not recognise what you say; retract, or I will
tear your soul from your body." The governor had, however, been advised
not to say what he did, because they were determined to kill him, and
these words might have occasioned a great disturbance among them, and
the party of the King might have snatched him from the hands of the
others, everybody being then in the street. Garcia Vanegas having
withdrawn a little, the governor repeated the same words; then Garcia
sprang with great fury on the governor, and placed a dagger to his
temple, saying to him as before: "Withdraw what you have said, or I
will tear your soul from your body." At the same moment he inflicted a
slight wound on his temple, and pushed the people who were carrying the
governor with so much violence that they fell with him, and one of them
dropped his cap. After this they quickly raised him again, and carried
him precipitately on board the brigantine. They closed the poop of the
vessel with planks, put two chains on him which prevented him from
moving; then they unmoored and descended the river.

Two days after the embarkation of the governor and the departure of the
brigantine, Domingo de Irala, the accountant Philip de Caceres, and the
factor Pedro Dorantes assembled their friends and attacked the house of
Captain Salazar. They seized him and Pedro de Estopinan Cabeza de
Vaca, put them in irons, and sent them down the river to overtake the
brigantine. These two officers were taken to Spain with him, and it is
certain that if Captain Salazar had wished it the governor would not
have been arrested, and still less would they have been able to take him
out of the country and carry him to Castille; but, as he remained deputy
governor, his conduct was not altogether frank. Cabeza de Vaca begged
that two of his servants might be allowed to accompany him to prepare
his food and attend upon him during the voyage. Accordingly they let the
two servants go, not however to wait on him, but to row four hundred
leagues on the river, for none could be found willing to do this work.
They forced some of the people to come, others fled into the interior,
and the property of such was confiscated and distributed among those
that were pressed for the service. The officers did a very wrong thing
during the voyage, and it was this: every two or three days they spread
among their partisans and their friends a thousand calumnies against
him, and finally said: "We have, as it is manifest, done you a great
deal of good and acted for your advantage and that of the king, in
consideration for this, sign this paper." In this way they filled four
quires of paper with signatures, and during the voyage down the river
composed their calumnious statements while these who had signed their
names to the paper remained at Ascension, three hundred leagues up the
river. It was upon this document that the charges brought against the
governor were framed.




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-FOURTH.

    _How they gave arsenic three times to the governor during the
    voyage._


WHILE descending the river the officers ordered a certain Biscayan named
Machin to prepare the food for the governor and then to pass it to Lope
Duarte, one of the confederates of Domingo de Irala, and guilty, like
the rest, of complicity in his arrest. He came from Spain as solicitor
to Domingo de Irala and to attend to his affairs. While the governor
journeyed in this fashion, arsenic was administered to him three times;
but as an antidote against this poison he carried with him a bottle of
oil and a piece of the horn of a unicorn. When he felt unwell he made
use of these remedies; day and night his sufferings were great. But it
pleased God that he escaped safely. He entreated the officers, Alonso
Cabrera and Garcia Vanegas, to allow his own servants to cook for him,
as he would take his meals from nobody else. To this they replied that
he would have to take his food from whomsoever they chose; if he did not
take it from the persons commissioned to give it him, he might die of
hunger, it mattered little to them. He abstained from food several days,
but hunger at length compelled him to take what they gave him. The
insurgents had promised several persons to take them on board the
caravel (afterwards destroyed) to Spain if they would support their
faction and help them to arrest the governor and not oppose them. Two of
these were Francisco de Paredes, a native of Burgos, and Friar Juan de
Salazar, of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy. They carried as prisoners
with them Luis de Miranda, Pedro Hernandez, Captain Salazar de
Espinosa, and Pedro Vaca. Having descended the river to the island of
San Gabriel, they would not allow either Francisco de Paredes or friar
Juan de Salazar to remain on board, fearing lest these two persons
should support the governor's cause in Spain, and give a true account of
what had happened. For this reason they compelled them to re-embark on
the brigantines that returned up the river to Ascension, although they
had sold their houses and property for much less than they were worth
when they were compelled to leave. This caused them to make such an
outcry that it was pitiable to hear them. Here the servants of the
governor, who had accompanied him thus far, rowing all the way, were
obliged to leave him, a loss he felt more than anything he had yet
endured; nor did they feel the separation less acutely. They remained
two days at the island of San Gabriel, when some of them left for
Ascension, and the others for Spain. The brigantine which bore the
governor had eleven banks of rowers, and contained twenty-seven persons
altogether.

They pursued their voyage down the river till they entered the sea, when
a violent tempest arose. The brigantine became waterlogged, and all the
provisions were spoilt; all that they managed to preserve was a little
flour, some lard, fish, and a little water. They were all very near
being drowned. The officers who had charge of the governor said that God
had sent them this terrible tempest as a punishment for the wrongs and
injustice they had made their prisoner suffer. They resolved, therefore,
to take off his chains and let him out of prison. Alonso de Cabrera
filed them asunder, Garcia Vanegas kissed his feet, though Cabeza de
Vaca would not allow it. They said openly that God had sent them those
four days' sufferings as a retribution for the wrongs they had done him.
They acknowledged they had grievously wronged him, and that all their
depositions were false; that the malice and jealousy they bore him
prompted them to administer two thousand false oaths, and this because
in three days he had discovered a country and a route, while those
who had lived in the country for twelve years had not been able to
accomplish it; and they implored his pardon, and that he would not
inform His Majesty how they had arrested him. As soon as they had taken
the chains off the governor the sea and wind subsided, and the tempest,
which had lasted four days, calmed down. We navigated in the open sea
for 2,500 leagues without having sight of land, and seeing nothing but
water and sky. All the food we had was a flour-cake fried in a little
lard, with a little water to drink. We were obliged to break off the
planks of our vessel to make a fire to cook our cake. In this way, with
infinite suffering, we arrived at the Azores, belonging to His most
serene Majesty of Portugal, the voyage having lasted three months. We
should not have suffered so severely from hunger had we touched on the
Brazilian coast, or at the island of St. Domingo, in the Indies; but
the officers dared not do this, for they felt guilty and dreaded being
arrested and brought to justice as rebels against their king. On
arriving at the Azores the officers in charge of the governor separated
because of the dissensions they had had, and each went his own way; but
first they tried to induce the justice of Angra to arrest the governor,
so as to prevent him from giving information to His Majesty of the
crimes and disorders they had committed. They alleged that when he
passed Cape Verd he had pillaged the port and country. The judge having
heard their deposition, told them to be gone, for his king would not
allow himself to be robbed, and did not keep his ports in such a weak
state of defence that anybody might dare to attack them. Having seen
that, in spite of their malice, they could do nothing to detain him,
they embarked, and arrived in Spain eight days before the governor, who
was delayed by contrary winds. Being the first to present themselves
at court, they gave out that Cabeza de Vaca had gone to the King of
Portugal to inform him about those countries beyond the sea. A few days
later the governor arrived at court. The night of his arrival all the
guilty parties disappeared; they went straight to Madrid, where they
hoped to find the court, as, in fact, they did. Meanwhile the Bishop of
Cuenca, who presided over the council of the Indies,[361] died. This
prelate would have punished the crimes and treason committed against
His Majesty in that country. Some days afterwards the officers and the
governor were released, on giving bail that they would not leave the
jurisdiction of the court. Garcia de Vanegas, who was one of those who
had arrested the governor, died a sudden, terrible death, his eyes
having fallen out of his head, and he never declared the truth of what
had passed. Alonso Cabrera, the supervisor, his accomplice, lost his
reason, and in a fit of frenzy he killed his wife at Loxa. The friars
who had taken part in the revolt and troubles also died suddenly, which
seemed to show the small blame attaching to the governor in his conduct
towards them. After keeping him eight years under arrest at court, he
was set at liberty and acquitted. He was relieved of his governorship
for divers reasons; for his enemies said that if he returned to punish
the guilty, he would have occasioned more troubles and dissensions in
that country. He therefore lost his appointment, besides other losses,
without receiving any compensation for all the money he had spent in
relieving the Spaniards, and in his voyage of discovery.

  [361] This was a special council for the government of the Spanish
  possessions in the Indies. It was called _Real Consejo de las
  Indias_.

Narrative of Hernando de Ribera.


IN the city of Ascension, which is by the river Paraguai, in the
province of Rio de la Plata, on the 3rd March, in the year of Our Lord,
1545, appeared before me, public notary, and the legal witnesses, being
in the church and monastery of Our Lady of Mercy, Redeemer of captives,
Captain Hernando de Ribera, conquistador in this province, and deposed
as follows: When Senor Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, governor and
adelantado and captain-general in the name of His Majesty, of the
province of Rio de la Plata, was in the port of Los Reyes, whence he
started on his exploration last year (1543), he commissioned me to take
one brigantine, and a certain number of men, and explore up a certain
river called Ygatu, which is an arm of two great rivers, viz., the
Yacareati and the Yaiva, flowing, according to the reports of the
Indians, through the settlements of the interior; and I, Hernando de
Ribera, having arrived at some Indians called Xarayes, in consequence of
information received from them, left the brigantine in a safe haven, and
entered the interior of the country with forty men, in order to see and
examine it with my own eyes. And having pursued my journey past many
Indian settlements, and obtained from their inhabitants and other
natives who came to see me, full reports touching the land, I examined
and sifted these statements, in order to learn the truth, being
moreover, acquainted with the language of the Carios, and therefore able
to hold intercourse with those tribes.

Juan Valderas, royal notary, whom I had with me at this time, wrote down
and made a note of certain things relating to that discovery. Yet I
would not tell him the whole truth concerning the riches and the
settlements of the various tribes inhabiting those regions, lest he
should write it in his report. And he, the said notary, did not know,
nor did he fully understand the matter, for my intention was at that
time to have communicated it directly to the governor, in order that he
might forthwith proceed to the conquest of that land, as it beseemed the
service of God and His Majesty.

After penetrating several days' journey into the interior, I was obliged
to return to the port of Los Reyes, in compliance with orders sent me
by the governor. And because I found him and all his people sick
on my arrival, I had no opportunity of reporting my discovery, nor
communicating all the information I had collected from the natives. A
few days afterwards he was compelled to return to Ascension to save the
lives of his people, and having again fallen sick a few days after his
arrival in that city, he was arrested by the officers of His Majesty (as
everybody knows), so that I was unable to make my statement.

Seeing that the officers of His Majesty are about to return to Spain
with the governor, and fearing that he may in the meanwhile die, or be
removed to some other place where the report might not be delivered
to him, and that His Majesty's service might in this way suffer loss,
and the governor himself be prejudiced, and that I might be held
blameworthy--taking all this, I say, into consideration, and for the
discharge of my conscience, now I, in order to serve God and the King,
and the governor in his name, desire to make a declaration of the said
discovery, that His Majesty may know of it and the reports I obtained
from the natives. I have therefore asked and required the notary to
receive my statement, which is as follows:

"I, Captain Hernando de Ribera, say and declare that on the 20th of
December last year (1543), I set out from the port of Los Reyes in
the brigantine _El Golondrino_ ('The Swallow') with fifty-two men, in
obedience to the governor's orders, and went on navigating the river
Ygatu, which is an arm of the aforesaid two rivers Yacareati and Yaiva,
and is very wide and voluminous; and on the sixth day I entered the
parent stream of these two water-courses. According to the reports of
the natives where I happened to land, these two rivers come from the
interior of the country, the Yaiva most probably from the Sierras
of Santa Martha. This river is wide and deep, and greater than the
Yacareati, which according to the Indians, flows from the Peruvian
Sierras; and between those two water-courses there is a wide expanse
of land, and innumerable villages and tribes. According to the natives,
the Yaiva and the Yacareati unite in the country of the Indians called
Perobazanes, and there they separate again, and seventy leagues lower
down they reunite.

"After navigating that river for seventeen days, I passed through the
land of the Perobazanes, and arrived at another country, where the
inhabitants are called Xarayes. These people are agriculturists, have
a quantity of provisions, and rear geese, fowls, and other birds. They
fish and hunt, and are a reasonable people, obeying their chief. Being
in one of their settlements, consisting of about a thousand houses, and
well received by their chief, Camire, I collected information concerning
the settlements of the interior. In consequence of that information, I
left the brigantine under the care of ten men, and taking a guide
from the said Xarayes, advanced three days inland, till I reached the
settlements of a tribe of Indians, called Urtueses, a good people,
cultivating the soil like the Xarayes. From this place, I went on
through an inhabited country, till I reached fourteen degrees twenty
minutes going westwards.

"While staying in the settlements of the Urtueses and Aburunes, many
chiefs of tribes farther inland came and spoke with me, and brought
feathers, like those of Peru, and metal plates in the rough. From them I
also obtained information, questioning each individually concerning the
settlements and tribes beyond. All these Indians told me that at ten
days' march from there, towards the west-north-west, there were women
inhabiting large villages, who possessed a large quantity of white and
yellow metal, and all their domestic utensils and vessels were of this
metal, and their chief was a woman. They are a warlike people, much
feared by the Indians. Before reaching those female warriors it is
necessary to pass a tribe of very small Indians, who make war upon
the women, and also upon those Indians who gave the information. At a
certain time of the year these women unite with their neighbours, and
cohabit with them. And if the children born of this intercourse be
girls, the mothers keep them; if they are boys, they send them as
soon as they are weaned to their fathers. On the other side of the
settlements of these women, bordering with them, there are very large
villages and tribes of Indians. These statements they made of their own
free will, without my asking them. They talked also of a large lake,
which they call the House of the Sun, because they say the sun locks
himself in there, and said that these women lived there between the
flanks of Santa Martha and the lake on the west-north-west, and that
beyond the settlements of those women were other large nations of black
people. According to the description they gave, these negroes are
eagle-faced, with pointed beards like the Moors. We asked them how they
knew those people to be black, and they answered that their fathers had
seen them and other tribes living in that neighbourhood had reported
it. These people clothe themselves, and have houses of stone and earth;
they are tall, and possess white and yellow metal in such abundance
that they make use of no other material for their domestic utensils and
vases, and all kinds of great vessels. We asked where those black people
lived, and they pointed to the north-west, saying, that should we wish
to go there, we might reach their settlements in fifteen days. And it
seemed to me, judging from the indications given by the Indians, that
those settlements lie in twelve degrees towards the north-west, between
the sierras of Santa Martha and Maranon. They are a race of warriors
fighting with bows and arrows. The same Indians also gave us to
understand that between west-north-west and north-west, one quarter
north, there are many tribes of Indians with such large settlements that
it is a day's journey to pass from one end to the other; and all are
rich in white and yellow metal, and wear clothes. They may be reached in
a short time, always passing through inhabited country.

"Farther to the west there is a large lake, so wide that it is
impossible to see from shore to shore, and by its side dwells a nation
who wear clothes, and possess much metal and brilliant stones, which
they work into the borders of their dress; and they find these stones in
the lake. They have large villages, are agriculturists, and have stores
of provisions, besides an abundance of geese and other birds. From the
place where I was they said I might reach the lake and its settlements
in fifteen days, always travelling through inhabited country, abounding
in metal, and by good roads. They offered to show us the way thither
when the floods subsided, though we were but few Christians, and the
settlements we should have to pass were very large and populous.

"I also formally declare that the Indians showed me by signs that in
the direction west, one quarter south-west, there are large towns, with
houses built of earth, inhabited by a good people, clothed, very rich,
and possessing plenty of metal. They rear a large number of great
sheep, using these for agriculture and transport. I asked if those
people were far off, and they answered that the route thither lay
through a thickly inhabited country, and that it was not far. Among
those people they said there were other Christians, and great waterless
deserts of sand. We asked them how they knew there were Christians on
that side, and they answered, that in times gone by the Indians living
in that neighbourhood had been heard to say that as they were passing
the desert they met many white people, clothed, with beards, and they
had certain animals with them (evidently, according to their showing,
horses), and riders on their backs, and that owing to the want of water
they had returned, and many had died on the way. The Indians thought
they had come from the other side of the desert. They showed us also, by
signs, that in the direction west, one quarter south, there were high
mountains, and an uninhabited country. Having heard that there were
people dwelling beyond those deserts, the Indians had attempted to pass
that way, but were unable to proceed, because they died of hunger
and thirst. We asked them how they came to learn all this, and they
answered, that all the Indians of this country communicated with
one another, and it had been related how those Indians had seen the
Christians and their horses crossing the desert. They said, too, that
on the south-west skirt of those mountains there were many large
settlements, and people rich in metal; and beyond these again lay the
salt water and the great ships. We asked them if those settlements were
ruled by separate chiefs, and they answered, that there was only one
chief who ruled all the towns, and was obeyed by all. I further declare,
that in order to verify their statements I questioned each of them
separately for a day and a night, and they always repeated the same
story without any variation whatever."

The above statement was made by Hernando de Ribera, who said and
declared that he had received it with all clearness, faithfully and
loyally, without fraud and deceit; and in order that all credit and
faith should be given to it, and that there should not be the slightest
doubt concerning it, or any portion thereof, he said he would swear to
the truth of it, and he swore in the name of God and Santa Maria, and on
the four sacred gospels, upon which he placed his right hand, a missal
being held open for that purpose by the reverend father, Francisco
Gonzalez Paniagua, at the very place where the sacred gospels are
written, and on the sign of the cross, like this: ? [Maltese cross],
where he also placed his right hand to testify that the aforesaid
statement, according to the form and manner of it, was given, said, and
declared by the Indian chiefs of the aforesaid land, and by other aged
men whom he had diligently examined and interrogated in order to learn
the truth, and have a clear understanding of the interior of the
country.

After he had obtained this information, other Indians of different
settlements came to see him, especially of a large village, called
Uretabere. He went one day's march in their territory, and collected
information wherever he went, and all the statements agreed. He
declared, moreover, under the sanctity of his oath, that there was no
exaggeration or imagination in anything he had said, nothing but the
truth, without fraud or reservation whatsoever. He also declared that
the Indians assured him that the river Yacareati has a fall from a high
mountain.

This he certifies to be true, so help him God, and if it be otherwise
may he pay dear in this world with his body, and in the next with his
soul. This oath having been read out to him, he said: "I swear it,
Amen."

The aforesaid captain asked and required me to testify to this
statement, as much for his peace of mind as to serve as evidence for
the aforesaid governor, and to preserve his rights; the following
being witnesses: the aforesaid reverend father Paniagua; Sebastian de
Valdivieso, valet of the said governor; Gaspar de Hortigosa and Juan
de Hoces, citizens of Cordoba, all of whom have signed their names as
follows: Francisco Gonzalez Paniagua, Sebastian de Valdivieso, Juan de
Hoces, Hernando de Ribera, Gaspar de Hortigosa.

  Done before me, Pedro Hernandez, notary.

  
INTRODUCTORY

“This King, to speak of him in terms equal to his deserving, was one
of the best sort of wonders, a wonder for wise men.” In those words
Francis Bacon summed up Henry VII., a hundred years after the first
Tudor king had been laid in his grave. Bacon’s history still is,
and is likely to remain, the classic narrative. Not that he was a
“contemporary,” or that he had access to any extraordinary sources
of information; but because being at once a practical politician, a
student of political theory, and a literary artist, any historical work
from his pen could hardly have failed to be of the highest interest,
and the subject he actually chose was--to him--peculiarly sympathetic.

It is in fact quite evident that Henry was held in the very highest
estimation by his biographer. The history is addressed to Prince
Charles, and it can hardly be doubted that in calling his hero “the
English Solomon,” Bacon had in mind the reigning king’s description as
the “Scottish Solomon”; the direct suggestion of a parallel (repeated
in other terms in the Preface) must have been meant to be looked
upon as a compliment by James. Henry was at least to be accounted
the shrewdest ruler amongst the very astute princes who were more or
less his contemporaries. Yet, for all the impression of shrewdness,
Bacon fails to win our sympathy for Henry, perhaps because those
two minds had too close kinship. Bacon, except in the case of a few
enthusiasts, does not inspire affection. Pope’s summary is too accurate
an expression of what is at least the popular conception; and Henry
is judged to have been not quite so bright, nearly but not quite
so wise--and still more mean. English history provides examples of
monarchs whom every one actively hates like King John, or scorns like
Edward II.; other monarchs too, who, if they had evil qualities, yet
display something of the heroic; towards whom our feelings, if mixed,
are still warm. But Henry VII. inspires almost universally a strong
sentiment of cold dislike, such as no one else creates.

There is justice in that impression, but there is also injustice. In
his latter years, it is hardly too much to call him detestable. He had
reigned for fourteen years before he committed the one commonplace
crime of tyrants which stains his record, the execution of Warwick.
From that time a kind of degeneration seems to have come upon him,
accelerated by the deaths first of his wisest counsellor Morton,
then, two years later, of the son he loved, and then of his wife. To
these years belongs nearly every story which tells seriously to his
discredit. But during the earlier and longer half of his reign, his
record is remarkably free from blemish, and shows an enlightenment
which under happier conditions might have won him a place not only
among the kings who have deserved well of the State--that, at least
in the historian’s eyes, he did achieve--but among those whose memory
posterity have cherished.


II

HENRY’S EARLY YEARS, ACCESSION, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DYNASTY

After the death of Henry V., his widow accepted in marriage the hand
of a Welsh knight of ancient lineage, Owen Tudor. In 1456, their son
Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, took to himself a very youthful bride,
the Lady Margaret Beaufort, the representative of John of Gaunt’s
family by Katherine Swynford, legitimatised by Act of Parliament in
the reign of Richard II. On January 28, 1457, Margaret gave birth to a
son, Henry, some weeks after Edmund himself had died; the charge of the
boy devolving mainly upon Edmund’s brother Jasper, Earl of Pembroke.
During the next fourteen years, the great Earl of Warwick was playing
see-saw with the fortunes of the rival houses of York and Lancaster.
In 1461, the Yorkists won the upper hand; but Jasper held out in
Wales for Lancaster, for nearly seven years. Then Harlech Castle was
surrendered, and young Henry was placed in charge of its captor, the
new Earl of Pembroke, and was well enough treated. Then Lancaster had
a turn of success, but the party was crushed at the battles of Barnet
and Tewkesbury, and the line was quenched by the deaths of Henry VI.
and his son. Yorkists and Lancastrians alike fixed upon young Henry
Tudor as being now the representative of John of Gaunt; England was
too dangerous a habitation for a possible claimant to the throne; and
the boy in his fifteenth year was successfully shipped off by his
friends to Brittany, where for twelve years he abode under the Duke’s
protection.

If the dynasty of York had established itself in regular fashion--if
Edward IV. had been followed by an Edward V. as Henry IV. had been
followed by Henry V.--there would have been little enough to fear. But
Edward’s brother usurped the throne by a particularly foul murder, and
being on it proved himself a tyrant. Men’s eyes turned to the one scion
of the Plantagenets whom it was possible to set up as a claimant to the
crown. If he could be set on the throne with Edward’s daughter at his
side, the rival factions of York and Lancaster might be stilled. The
first attempt to challenge the usurper failed completely. Buckingham’s
plan of campaign was ruined by the flooding of the Severn, and by a
storm which scattered the fleet wherewith Richmond sailed from Brittany
to co-operate. Henry, returning thither, had to flee very soon after
to safer shelter in France. But it was not long before the attempt was
renewed, this time with success. On Bosworth field Richard was slain,
and Henry declared King of England.

The victor was a young man of eight-and-twenty. For fourteen years he
had lived in England, amidst civil broils and perpetual alarms. For
fourteen more he had lived mainly in Brittany, conscious that he was in
perpetual danger of being surrendered into the hands of those who might
at any time find his destruction convenient. All his life he had been
in an atmosphere of suspicion, of possible treachery, encompassed with
deeds of blood. He had learned to study others and to trust himself. He
had learned that his life might depend on alertness and self-restraint.
And he had been able to see that Louis XI. was incomparably the most
successful master of state-craft of his generation. These were lessons
calculated to kill all youthful qualities, and at twenty-eight Henry
might as well have been forty.

This was the man who had grasped a sceptre to which it was impossible
to establish for him a legal title. In plain truth, he was King of
England because he was the only man of the blood-royal who was able to
challenge the usurper who was wearing the crown. As far as right of
inheritance went, if Edward IV.’s daughters were barred by their sex,
the son of Clarence was indubitably the heir of Edward III., whether
descent through the female line were admitted or no. Henry might marry
Elizabeth of York and claim the crown in her right; but then her death
would leave him in a highly anomalous position; it was imperative that
he should be accepted himself as the lawful king in his own person.
The marriage might make matters perfectly safe for a son, but not for
him. Hence even the semblance of depending on his wife’s title must be
avoided.

He had won the realm by the sword; that was the first step. The second
was to commit the representatives of the nation to affirm that he
was the lawful sovereign: this was effected by a Declaratory Act in
Parliament, which judiciously abstained from naming the grounds on
which his claim rested. After that was to come the marriage, which
should muzzle the partisans of York. This took place in the following
January; but it is easy to see that the king had good reason for not
proceeding to his wife’s coronation at least till a son should be
born. Not long after that son was born, the Simnel plot was brewing;
the coronation under those circumstances might have taken the colour
of a defensive measure. Consequently the ceremony was not performed
until Elizabeth had been his wife for very nearly two years, being thus
emphasised as a mere act of grace.

No doubt if, by marrying the Plantagenet princess, Henry could have
appropriated the Yorkist title to himself personally whether his queen
lived or died, he would have been able to do without repressing the
heads of the Yorkist faction at all. But, as things stood, that could
not be risked. Warwick, Clarence’s young son, was imprisoned in the
Tower, and some of the last king’s principal supporters were attainted.
Being thus kept dissatisfied, it was a long time before active Yorkist
plots ceased. The Dowager Duchess of Burgundy, Margaret, sister of
Edward IV., made her Court a regular centre of anti-Tudor intrigue; nor
did Henry ever feel really safe till the myth of a surviving Richard of
York was finally exploded and the actual Edward Plantagenet, Earl of
Warwick, had been done to death. The course which Henry took involved
a certain degree of injustice--but _Fiat Justitia, Ruat Cælum_, is
a maxim that princes with an uncertain title are rarely, if ever,
disposed to adopt without reservation. One is disposed to wonder rather
that Warwick was allowed to live so long than that Henry ultimately
yielded to the temptation to slay him.

This plain business of securing himself on the throne was necessarily
the first consideration. Only an established dynasty could restore
steady government in a country which within a hundred years had seen
four kings slain and the great bulk of her ancient baronage wiped
out. Between foreign wars, successful or the reverse, and a wild
warfare of armed factions at home, stability had been destroyed.
The prolonged reign of strong rulers maintaining one policy was an
absolute condition of recuperation. The way in which Henry secured it
was entirely characteristic and entirely successful. The sword, the
poniard, and the headman’s axe or the dungeon, were normally relied on
by rulers whose seat was uncertain. Henry acted on a strictly original
scheme. When he took the field against rebels, he sent before him
proclamations of pardon to those who would come in; and he kept his
word. He did not massacre the routed foe: he spared them, seizing only
their leaders. He was responsible for no murders. A Lambert Simnel or
a Perkin Warbeck when captured was not hanged out of hand, but sent to
join the scullions, or set in the stocks as an impostor. Executions
were singularly rare; rebels who might become powerful merely had their
claws clipped by fines and confiscations--very efficiently clipped, no
doubt. Where imprisonment was resorted to, the confinement was seldom
harsh; and the king never had qualms about restoring a quondam rebel
to favour and authority, if he judged that his man would show himself
worthy of the faith reposed in him. When Surrey’s gaoler offered to let
him go free, Surrey refused to escape; the king had put him in ward,
and the king alone should release him. The king did so, and gave him a
command of the highest trust. Kildare set authority at defiance when
he was Deputy in Ireland, and when he was deposed, “All Ireland cannot
rule this man,” said his enemies. “Then let this man rule all Ireland,”
quoth Henry, and restored him to the Deputyship. Neither Surrey nor
Kildare gave him cause for repentance.

Such a record would have entitled Henry to praise as a prince of
unparalleled magnanimity, but for its common-sense accompaniment
of fines and confiscations. But in fact, to penalise rebellion in
some sort was an absolute necessity; not to have done so would have
jeopardised the throne. The method adopted might not be heroic, but it
was supremely practical; inasmuch as it wrought the minimum of positive
injury to the punished, while at once depriving them of power to harm
and supplying the king himself with the sinews of government, of which
he was sorely in need. It was dictated quite as much by policy as by
magnanimity, but the mere fact that Henry recognised it from the outset
as sounder policy than any precedents, recent at any rate, suggested,
is testimony to the acuteness of his moral perceptions as well as to
the keenness of his intelligence. Nor is it fair to deprive Henry of
the credit of magnanimity, merely because the magnanimity paid. To
realise that it did pay and prove completely successful, we have only
to observe that after the battle of Stoke there was no baronial rising
in England. Warbeck got all his support either from the exiles or from
foreign courts: when he tried to raise the West of England on his own
account, he collapsed ignominiously. It is true that an army of Cornish
insurgents had marched to Blackheath just before, and had there been
broken up; but that was a purely popular rising in protest against
taxation, and its chiefs were a blacksmith and a lawyer.


III

THE TUDOR ABSOLUTISM AND THE EXCHEQUER

It was not sufficient, however, merely to secure the sceptre in the
hands of a strong king; it was necessary further to establish a strong
system. For half a century the great power and estates of individual
barons had enabled them to keep the country in perpetual turmoil.
The idea of universal obedience to the established government simply
because it was established had vanished from the military and political
classes: the idea even of concerted government by one class, guided by
its interests as a class, had disappeared; it was only the personal
factor, personal interests, that counted. Below the baronage, the
gentry who bordered on the baronage, and their retainers, townsfolk and
country folk stood aloof from the fighting, and lived as peacefully
as they might--all things considered, with a wonderful freedom from
disturbance. But standing aloof from the fighting, they had perforce
stood aloof also from the business of government, which fell to the
military faction that happened for the time being to have the upper
hand. They were in short ready to support and profit by a government
which gave promise of peace and stability, order and justice; but
they were not ready to organise such a government for themselves, or
to take a prominent part in conducting it. Under such conditions, the
Yorkists had established a despotism, as the only workable form of
government. But their despotism was one that rested almost exclusively
on the personal forcefulness of the ruler. It was Henry’s task to keep
the effective power concentrated in the King’s hands, but to give it
a constitutional colour--to make the nation feel it as a government
by consent. It was therefore necessary to eliminate factors which
naturally tended to disturbance--in other words, to deprive the
individual barons of the power of aggressive self-assertion; and at the
same time, so to treat the naturally orderly elements of society as to
keep them on the side of the government.

This was the root-principle of the Tudor Absolutism, devised and put
into practice by the first Tudor king, and systematically carried
out by his son and grand-daughter. The system carried England to the
first place among the nations. But it broke down when the Stuarts
ignored its fundamental principle, and so treated the naturally orderly
elements of society as to turn them against the government. For under
the system, those elements acquired the power of organisation and
self-protection, as the accompaniment of the prosperity they enjoyed
increasingly; and it followed that the system could only remain stable
so long as there was essential harmony and sympathy between the monarch
and his subjects.

For the concentration of power, effective power, in the king’s hands,
money was essential; while to keep the general population contented, it
was necessary that their purses should not be subjected to too severe
exactions, which must fall elsewhere. Henry directed them against the
nobility. The nation at large had no objection; the king’s treasury was
filled and the power of the nobles curtailed by the same operation.
Thus the king eliminated the disturbing factor, or allowed it to
eliminate itself. When noblemen got themselves mixed up with treasons,
they could not complain if their lives were spared and their goods paid
the forfeit. They had been wont to maintain great households, every man
having in his service the nucleus of an army. These crowds of retainers
were forbidden by law, as being, for obvious reasons, a public danger.
If noblemen, accustomed to over-ride the law, chose to keep up their
households in despite of it, they could not expect sympathy when they
were called upon to pay in cash the penalty of breaking the law. These
measures were not only thoroughly defensible as being entirely free
from any taint of injustice; they also served directly to relieve
taxation, to fill the royal coffers, and to make wanton insurrection
difficult.

Yet, while keeping within what might be called legitimate bounds, as he
habitually did while Morton was alive, the king undoubtedly permitted
himself to apply methods which savoured of trickery. He made great
parade of a war with France, appealing to national patriotism to supply
the funds. The appeal was successful, but there was no corresponding
expenditure on the campaign. Excellent reasons for inactivity were of
course forthcoming, but it is none the less certain that no activity
was ever contemplated. All that was intended was a demonstration which
might induce the French monarch to buy the English king off with
solid cash--as he eventually did. The whole transaction was eminently
profitable, but Henry had certainly got his money out of his own
subjects by false pretences. The same plea was resorted to, to get
benevolences authorised, when the famous dilemma traditionally--but
as it would seem quite unjustly--attributed to Cardinal Morton
was applied. People who lived handsomely could obviously afford a
contribution by curtailing their extravagance; people who did not live
handsomely must have wealth laid by. In either case, there could be
no inability to serve the king’s need. The spirit which prompted the
invention of that dilemma is illustrated in a story reported by Bacon
as traditional. Henry paid a visit to the Earl of Oxford at Henningham,
where he was sumptuously entertained, and on his departure passed
out through a lane of the earl’s retainers drawn up to do him honour.
“These, no doubt, are your menial servants,” observed the king. The
earl demurred; they were not menials, but retainers, who had turned out
to do him credit when he had so distinguished a guest. Whereupon “The
king started a little, and said, ‘By my faith, my lord, I thank you for
my good cheer, but I may not endure to have my laws broken in my sight.
My attorney must speak with you.’ And it is part of the report that the
earl compounded for no less than fifteen thousand marks.” It is obvious
that such a story might have been developed out of some really quite
justifiable incident; but it is tolerably certain that it was not only
in his closing years that Henry displayed what we may call an unkingly
acquisitiveness.

In passing, however, it may be remarked that this was a family trait.
Elizabeth inherited her grandfather’s prejudice against spending a
shilling that could be kept in her purse, or neglecting any plausible
pretext for attracting coin into it. She also inherited his business
principle of repaying every loan he contracted with unfailing
punctuality. Henry VIII. did not indeed practise economy, but he could
haggle over a money bargain as keenly as his father or his daughter,
and his generosity, when he indulged it, was usually at the expense of
another pocket than his own. The art of appropriating in the public
eye credit to which he was not in the least entitled, was one of which
he was a past master; it was one the value of which his father, who
certainly neglected any efforts to make himself personally popular,
somewhat underrated. Thrift is a virtue; for Henry VII., a particularly
necessary virtue; but it is not one that under any circumstances helps
to make him who exercises it attractive. When it assumes a sordid
aspect, it becomes definitely repellent.

That did not trouble Henry; he wanted money, and during the greater
part of his reign he got it without flagrant extortion; with such
success, too, that in his later years he was able almost entirely to
work without calling Parliament: the skill with which he conducted his
foreign negotiations on the same cash principles contributing not a
little to this result.


IV

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY

It was characteristic of Henry, and somewhat unfortunate for his
reputation, that he cared nothing at all about investing his policy
with any showiness unless some specific end was to be gained thereby.
The objects his government had in view were essentially prosaic:
commonplace they cannot be called, because in a mediæval monarch they
were eminently original. It was customary for kings to interfere in
commercial affairs chiefly when they saw their way to collect by so
doing contributions to the exchequer, or when it seemed worth while
to make enactments in favour of capital as against labour. Henry has
the credit of being the first English king who clearly recognised
commercial development as a primary care of government: which hitherto
only the oligarchical city-states of Italy and the German free-towns
had done. It is true that he was quite ready to subordinate the
commercial to a political end; to attack those who sheltered his
enemies, not with pikes and culverins but with commercial restrictions
only less injurious to English trade than to that of the antagonist.
He did so without suffering from the illusion that the loss of the
foreign merchant was the gain of the English. In these cases he
weighed the economic loss against the political gain. In mediæval
practice, the economic consideration would have counted for practically
nothing in the scale. In the eyes of some politicians to-day, no
political advantage would be worth counting as against an economic
inconvenience--and it is usually extremely difficult to show that a
political advantage will accompany an economic inconvenience. But Henry
was only just emerging from mediæval conceptions. The remarkable thing
is that he realised commerce as an object of policy at all, not that
he rated its importance lower than Adam Smith: that he relaxed the
mediæval theory, not that he did not discard it altogether.

This argument is not to be misunderstood. It has nothing to do with
the rightness or wrongness of any economic theory, but only with the
place of economics in the whole scheme of government. Henry thought it
worth while, as every king before him would have done, almost to cut
off England from her best market for her most paying product, wool,
if he could thereby force the archduke’s government to withdraw its
effective countenance from Perkin Warbeck. But he made it a constant
object of his policy to negotiate the opening of fresh markets for that
commodity, and when he came to terms with the archduke, the commercial
benefits to be secured by the treaty known as the _Intercursus Magnus_
were his first care.

As Henry was the first to give commercial considerations a leading
place in his system, so he is to be distinguished for the attention he
gave to shipping; on which head Bacon has a rather remarkable note, to
the effect that he deserves praise for perceiving that in this instance
it was worth while to diminish commerce for the sake of developing
the marine--to subordinate the economic loss to the political gain.
If Bacon read Henry’s mind aright, he was not under the delusion
that the protection of English shipping interests by his successive
Navigation Acts was of direct economic advantage; but he did see that
it was worth while to pay the price in order to give England such a
mercantile navy as in Bacon’s own day enabled her to win the supremacy
of the seas. Those Acts, restricting the importation of foreign goods
to English ships, raised the price of imports without benefiting any
English industry at all except that of the shippers; but the impetus
given to shipping provided the country with a fighting force at sea
which ultimately enabled her to challenge the might of Spain. The naval
development of England was the work of the Tudor dynasty, though Edward
I., Edward III., and Henry V., had ideas. Whether the Navigation Acts
really did give the impetus attributed to them--as to which economists
may dispute--the intention is unmistakable, and the foresight which
deliberately set up naval development as an end to be pursued is a very
clear mark of Henry’s statesmanship. The creation of the English navy
is generally credited either to King Alfred or to Henry VIII.; but the
latter certainly inherited the conception from his father.

It is matter for regret, but hardly for reproach, that the king did not
apply his ideas of maritime expansion more actively in another field,
that of oceanic exploration. Portugal and Spain were allowed to take
the lead. Yet it was so well known that the English king was favourable
to such enterprises that it appears only to have been an accident which
placed Christopher Columbus in the service of Ferdinand and Isabella
instead of in Henry’s. How history might have been affected if the
West Indies had fallen in the first instance to England instead of to
Spain, is an interesting subject of speculation. But Spain won the
prize. The sailors who put out from Bristol port tried their chance in
more northerly latitudes; the territories they discovered were very
unpromising; and after the outset the Genoese (or Venetian) Cabots,
sailing in command of English crews, naturally enough got little
support from the king. But at the outset--that is, before it seemed
probable if not certain that Spain and Portugal, by right of priority
backed by a Papal Bull, had, so to speak, staked out a claim to
all that was worth having--Henry gave material encouragement to the
exploring spirit.

There was, indeed, one important economic problem--with
concomitants--at grappling with which no serious attempt was made. This
was the growing agricultural depression: due in part to legitimate and
in part to illegitimate action on the part of landowners. There was a
very large demand for English wool for foreign looms. Sheep-breeding
was seen to be highly lucrative, whereas tillage was not. The landowner
saw no sufficient reason why he should be called upon to provide
employment for a quantity of labour which brought him in a small
return, when the employment of a very little labour over the same area
would bring him a large return. Therefore he converted his arable
lands into pasture for sheep. Economic history abounds in cases of
the displacement of labour by the decay, temporary or permanent, of
some industry which is ceasing to be lucrative: it abounds also with
examples of legislative attempts to maintain the decaying industries,
and to compel some one or other to provide employment for the displaced
labour. Such attempts appear to be doomed to failure. No remedy has
yet been found except the development of fresh industries which in
course of time absorb that displaced labour. Even in the twentieth
century, that is a process which might take years to accomplish; in
the period which we are considering, the rural displacement took a
century to remedy. Political altruists, like More or Somerset, tried
to set legislation to work, but with the usual want of success. The
encouragement of commercial enterprise which begets new industries
was the only hopeful direction to work in, and to that Henry’s policy
tended; but it was not till Elizabeth’s government pursued the same
policy that the industrial situation was appreciably affected.
Legislation did a little towards checking the rapidity with which small
holdings were being absorbed into great estates, and great estates were
being converted into sheep-runs, but it never amounted to more than a
very feeble brake. The problem is one which still awaits a satisfactory
solution.


V

JUDICATURE

Bacon enumerates with applause a variety of good laws enacted by Henry.
He was not in fact remarkable as a legislator, but his modifications
of the law were all save one in the nature of removal of abuses. There
are, however, two of his enactments which demand special attention. The
first of these was the Act of 1487, which gave statutory recognition
to judicial functions which had for some time been exercised by the
Privy Council or a committee thereof, sitting in a room known as the
Star Chamber. In later days, this Court of Star Chamber was perverted
into an instrument of tyranny; in Henry’s time, it was the only
judicial body which was out of reach of the fear or suspicion of being
terrorised by a powerful noble. It had come into being because the
Sanction of the ordinary law was inadequate to deal with barons who
chose to over-ride the law. The Privy Council could make and enforce
its decrees without fear. Under these conditions, the powers it had
assumed were necessary to the assertion of the royal authority against
offenders who contemned the normal Courts.

Without the confident maintenance of the king’s authority against such
offenders, the recurrence of the anarchy of the last fifty years would
have constantly threatened; but it is obvious that the powers needed
to that end might be misused for the ends of tyranny. Yet for more
than a century the Court exercised its functions unmistakably for the
public weal. Henry’s Act is notable, not as creating the Court, but as
formally recognising and regulating its duties; a sound step, tending
to prevent its abuse, not to introduce its use.

The other Act, however, that of 1495, is not capable of any such
defence. It was abused from the beginning, and was the great instrument
of those exactions by the notorious Empson and Dudley, which so stain
the record of the latter half of Henry’s reign. Its repeal was one
of the first and most popular acts of his successor. It is to be
remembered, however, that though Empson and Dudley were not slow in
getting to their evil work, their grosser activities were exercised in
the last decade of the reign after Cardinal Morton’s decease. Henry
was never generous; but the thrift and “nearness” of his earlier
days took some time in developing into the grasping sordidness of
his later years. More than half his reign had passed before the term
extortionate could be applied to him without exaggeration. The Act,
when it was passed, purported to be, and probably was, intended to
prevent offenders against the law from escaping justice through lack
of an accuser. It permitted judges to institute in their own Courts,
on information laid by a resident in the district, proceedings for
offences not involving penalties affecting the life or limb of
the guilty party. Such men as Empson and Dudley, however, had no
difficulty--with partial if not complete connivance from the king--in
procuring information which would enable them under colour of law to
impose extortionate fines for the king’s benefit and incidentally to
extract from the victims very handsome perquisites for themselves.


VI

FOREIGN POLICY

The reign of Henry V. had made the English king as powerful a monarch
as any in Europe. The sixty-three years that intervened between his
death and the accession of Henry VII. saw England lose her pride of
place among the nations. On the other hand, the attempt of Charles
the Bold to create a central Burgundian kingdom had failed, while,
partly on the wreck of his schemes, Louis XI. had consolidated the
French monarchy, and the kingdom he left to Charles VIII. required
for its completion only the effective absorption of Brittany. The
union of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella
had raised Spain to a new position, which in like manner lacked but
one thing, the conquest of the Moorish kingdom of Granada, for its
complete establishment. Maximilian, “King of the Romans,” heir to
Austria and practically heir to the Imperial crown, had strengthened
his own position by marrying the Duchess of Burgundy, Charles the
Bold’s daughter, and thus acquiring a paramount interest in the wealthy
Netherlands. England, with her internal turmoils and her lost military
prestige, had for the moment lost all weight in the counsels of Europe.
Even had the immediate termination of civil discord been assured, she
was too much exhausted to recover her place by force of arms; and as
long as there was a Yorkist Pretender at large, civil discord could not
be regarded as conclusively at an end. Nevertheless, even during the
years while his dynasty was threatened, the king’s diplomatic skill
completely changed the relations of England and the Continental Powers;
while his policy towards Scotland kept the normal hostility of the
Northern kingdom in check, and bore ultimate fruit in the union of the
crowns, a century afterwards. He did not, like Wolsey--his disciple as
far as methods were concerned--achieve or aim at a dominant position;
but when English interests were concerned, the voice of England could
not in his later years be neglected, as at the beginning of the reign.

He worked not by exploits in the stricken field but by diplomacy,
therein illustrating his modernity. He sent armies into Brittany
and Picardy, but they were intended to threaten, not to strike. He
found a kindred spirit in Ferdinand of Aragon: of whom Louis XII. in
later years complained that he had once cheated him. “He lies,” said
Ferdinand, with pride; “I have cheated him three times.” Ferdinand’s
respect was reserved for Henry, whom he could not cheat at all, or even
out-wit, which is not quite the same thing. Henry did not cheat--that
is, he did not break faith; but his engagements were always so
carefully hedged that the smallest evasion on the part of an ally could
be made an adequate ground for complete evasion on his own. He could
not prevent the absorption of Brittany; but the French king, as soon as
he turned his ambitions towards Italy, found that Henry could hamper
him so seriously that he willingly bought him off. Maximilian remained
impecunious--harmless, therefore, unless he could persuade some one
else to finance him--since the Netherlands declined to recognise his
authority. As for Ferdinand, Henry fought him with his own weapons; and
evenly matched as they were, the Englishman did not prove less adept
than the Spaniard. Their first treaty seemed a very one-sided affair;
but Henry in fact won by it that recognition which was of the first
importance to him at that early stage, while he appeared to render in
return a great deal more than he actually gave. In 1495, the Spanish
sovereigns attached so much value to his alliance that in spite of
haggling they were obliged next year to concede him his own terms,
which, though not extravagant, were much higher than they liked, and
very much higher than he would have ventured even to propose six or
seven years earlier. But they could still regard the betrothal of their
daughter Katherine to the Prince of Wales as something of an act of
grace on their part. Four years later, it is evident that they thought
Henry could better afford to break that marriage off than they could
themselves: and again a little later, when Prince Arthur died, they
were not a whit less desirous than Henry himself of betrothing the
young widow to the new Prince of Wales. This restoration of status
Henry achieved at the cost of nothing more than some military parade
which was very much more than recouped out of the French treasury.

The key to Henry’s success is to be found just in the fact that the
most astute of his rivals was quite unable to trick him; secondly, in
his skilful avoidance of any measures which committed him to a position
from which he could not retreat without loss of prestige. His value
to Spain lay chiefly in his ability to hamper France. Presently Spain
awoke to his capacity for restricting the hampering process precisely
within the limits which were convenient to himself, which might be very
much narrower than suited her. Presently again it appeared that he
might find it still more convenient to join hands with France, which
would minimise the use to be made of Maximilian. Instead of Henry being
in need of assistance against France, which might be doled out at the
convenience of Spain, Spain had to supply inducements to keep England
on her side. As a matter of fact, Henry to the last needed Ferdinand
quite as much as Ferdinand needed him, but succeeded in giving a
different impression.


VII

CHARACTER

Our survey so far seems to show conclusively that for some two-thirds
of his reign Henry conducted the business which had devolved upon
him not only with remarkable practical success but without at
all justifying the sinister impression of his character which is
indubitably prevalent. Yet, even without the record of his later years,
as to which something remains to be said, this unattractive impression
is not unnatural. We feel that a great ruler of a great nation ought to
have something about him, majestic, splendid, heroic. We even forgive a
man for evil deeds done in a grand style; we do not feel our admiration
stirred even by good deeds done in a pedestrian style. Magnanimity
loses its flavour when we scent policy in it. We are offended with
a king who is not kingly, and kingliness demands those Aristotelian
virtues which are generally rendered as Magnanimity and Magnificence.
They are attributes in which the seventh Henry is conspicuously
deficient.

A phrase at the beginning of the foregoing paragraph was employed
with definite intention. Henry treated kingship as a business. He
entered upon it very much as a new managing director might enter upon
the conduct of a great concern which demands re-organisation. He knows
that the retention of his position depends on his successfulness; that
success is possible only if he has a free hand, while his board likes
to think that it is exercising the real control. He has to establish
confidence in himself within, and to re-establish confidence in the
house without. He avoids palpable injustice; no one can call him
dishonest; he knows exactly how far he can trust clients, and rely
on the co-operation of other establishments in a joint policy; and
he makes that business a distinct success--but he is not very likely
to make himself personally popular, or in any sense an object of
enthusiasm. For that, something is needed over and above a strict and
capable attention to business; and the something over and above was
wanting in Henry Tudor. In keenness of intelligence, he was more than
a match for the most astute of living statesmen. The general rectitude
of his aims was commendable; the moderation of his methods was
meritorious. He did good service to the nation over which he ruled. He
was not cruel; he was not capricious; he was never guided by prejudice
or passion; but he remains hopelessly and irredeemably unsympathetic.

Yet had he died within a year or two of his best minister, his portion
would have been cold praise, but still praise. He outlived Morton by
nearly nine years, whose baleful shadow is over his whole career,
turning a negative into a positive dislike. For in those years every
baser quality of which there is any hint in the earlier days becomes
intensified.

He had always treated marriage primarily as an affair of politics,
as was natural and inevitable, but with a sufficient respect for its
moral aspects to keep him faithful to his own wife. Yet when his son
died, the idea of joining the widow to his second son had for him
none of that repulsion which it excited almost universally in his
day. It is even said that when his own queen died he contemplated
marrying Katherine himself. It is quite certain that he contemplated
marrying Katherine’s sister Joanna of Castile, although he knew her
to be mentally deranged. His economy degenerated into niggardliness;
his politic scheming to fill his treasury developed into a griping
greed for gold. Empson and Dudley carried on their nefarious work of
extortion with his knowledge and sanction. He grew vindictive, and when
Thomas More opposed a subsidy in the Parliament of 1504, he sought an
excuse for fining the father, and the “beardless boy” himself had to
retire into private life, lest a worse thing should befall him. He had
always considered himself at liberty to break the spirit of a promise
provided that he kept the letter; but, if tradition does not wrong him,
when the Earl of Suffolk was surrendered on promise that he would not
put him to death, he took care to suggest to the Prince of Wales that
the promise would not bind his heir when his time came.

The man revealed to us in these later years is ugly, sordid, very
unlovely. But this man does not truly or fairly present to us the
real Henry who restored order in England, and recovered for her a
respectable position among the nations; holding his own in a singularly
difficult situation and keeping at bay the onslaughts of an embittered
faction at the cost of a quite astonishingly small amount of bloodshed,
and with the minimum of anything that could reasonably be called
injustice towards antagonists. This at least England owes to him, that
he did more than any of his predecessors to lay the foundations of her
commercial greatness; that he recognised more clearly than any of them
the benefit of her maritime development.

The man moreover was not altogether lacking in some finer qualities
which seem to have withered when his degeneration set in. He who
seems almost an incarnation of chill-blooded, unemotional craftiness
was capable of very human and very tender feeling. A record from the
hand of an anonymous contemporary, when his son Arthur died, has been
transcribed before, and is worth transcribing again.

“In the year of our Lord God 1502, the second day of April, in the
castle of Ludlow, deceased Prince Arthur, first begotten son of our
sovereign Lord, King Henry the Seventh, and in the 17th year of his
reign. Immediately after his death Sir Richard Poole his Chamberlain,
with other of his Council, wrote and sent letters to the King and
Council to Greenwich, where his Grace and the Queen’s lay, and
certified them of the Prince’s departure. The which Council discreetly
sent for the King’s ghostly father, a friar observant, to whom they
showed this most sorrowful and heavy tidings, and desired him in his
best manner to show it to the King. He in the morning of the Tuesday
following, and somewhat before the time accustomed, knocked at the
King’s chamber door; and when the King understood that it was his
Confessor, he commanded to let him in. The Confessor then commanded all
those there present to avoid, and after one salutation began to say _Si
bona de Manu Domini suscipimus, mala autem quare non sustineamus?_ and
so showed his Grace that his dearest son was departed to God. When his
Grace understood that sorrowful heavy tidings he sent for the Queen,
saying that he and his Queen would take the painful sorrows together.
After that she was come, and saw the King her lord and that natural and
painful sorrow, as I have heard say, she with full great and constant
comfortable words, besought his Grace that he would, first after God,
remember the weal of his own noble person, the comfort of his realm
and of her. She then said that my lady his mother had never no more
children but him only, and that God by his grace had ever preserved him
and brought him where that he was; over that, how that God had left
him yet a fair prince, two fair princesses; and that God is where he
was, and we are both young enough; and that the prudence and wisdom of
his Grace sprung over all Christendom, so that it should please him
to take this accordingly thereunto. Then the King thanked her of her
good comfort. After that she was departed and come to her own chamber,
natural and motherly loss smote her so sorrowful to the heart, that
those that were about her were fain to send for the King to comfort
her. Then his Grace, of true, gentle, and faithful love, in good haste
came and relieved her, and showed her how wise counsel she had given
him before; and he for his part would thank God for his son, and would
she should do in like wise.”

That story, obviously derived from an actual witness, gives a fine
impression of Elizabeth; but it no less obviously implies a very
genuine affection subsisting between her and Henry, and a very
sincere devotion in both to their son. Henry, however, was by nature
a reserved and somewhat lonely man, and Elizabeth’s death not long
after deprived him of the last softening influence. His whole life
had been a tremendous strain. His boyhood and early manhood aged him
prematurely. From the day that he landed in England to wrest the
sceptre from Richard, the strain had never relaxed; the bow had never
been slackened. At five-and-forty, he may well have been as much worn
out as are men less severely tried twenty-five years later in life.
The work he had to do was anything but inspiriting; he did it with
dogged patience. The task was thankless, and he got little thanks. It
was accomplished ungraciously, and he receives no grace in return. A
dreary life, and a dreary reign; yet the reign is not without admirable
qualities, nor the life without gleams of nobility.




CARDINAL WOLSEY


I

APPRECIATIONS

                              He was a man
    Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
    Himself with princes; one that by suggestion
    Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play:
    His own opinion was his law: i’ the presence
    He would say untruths and be ever double,
    Both in his words and meaning. He was never,
    But when he meant to ruin, pitiful:
    His promises were, as he then was, mighty:
    But his performance, as he is now, nothing.

In these words, Shakespeare or another has summed up the character of
the great Cardinal as it presented itself to his enemies. As Katharine
painted him, posterity has for the most part regarded him. Men who have
risen from the ranks, and in their prosperity assume the state and
splendour appropriate to hereditary position, are rarely popular. When
they are so, it is because they have identified their names in some
sort with popular causes. Of all the statesmen who for a long term of
years controlled or seemed to control the destinies of England, not one
perhaps has found apologists so few as Thomas Wolsey.

Of recent years, however, there has been a change. It has hardly
yet made its way into popular accounts; but the attitude of serious
historians has been at least largely modified by the publication of the
State Papers under the editorship of the late Dr. Brewer, and of his
Introductions to those volumes. The doctrine used to be that Wolsey was
a man of exceeding arrogance who acquired a pernicious mastery over the
mind of Henry VIII., and whose political achievement consisted mainly
in a miserably fruitless meddling with foreign affairs in which England
had no concern, dictated by an insatiable ambition for the Papal crown.
Whereas Dr. Brewer and Bishop Creighton after him have laid it down
that Wolsey raised England from the position of a third or fourth-rate
Power to an equality with the greatest nations in Europe.

During the years of his power, it is at least clear that Wolsey did
achieve for England such a position among the nations as she had not
held, at any rate since the days of Henry V.; and that he did this,
not, like Henry V., by aggressive militarism, but by diplomatic skill:
that he sought to be, and to a great extent succeeded in being, the
pacificator of Europe as well as the aggrandiser of England. In his
aim and method, however, he followed in the footsteps of Henry VII.,
and his policy was a natural development, though a vast extension, of
that laid down by that astute monarch. And in the second aspect of his
policy, he was again developing that of the old king, in striving to
make the power of the Crown independent alike of the old nobility and
of Parliament.

[Illustration: _CARDINAL WOLSEY_

_From a Painting by_ HOLBEIN _in the collection at Christ Church,
Oxford_]

But a recent biographer[A] has ventured so far as to declare that
“Wolsey stands out as the greatest statesman England has ever produced;
and it is not going beyond what records reveal if we say his was the
master-mind of his age”--the age of Erasmus and Luther.

      [A] Taunton, “Thomas Wolsey, Legate and Reformer,” p. 3.

That is unfortunately a species of criticism which excites the spirit
of hostility. Wolsey was of that type of politicians, rare in England,
who have made foreign affairs their first interest: also he was, what
probably no other Englishman ever has been, beyond all comparison the
ablest diplomatist among his contemporaries. Diplomacy is a field in
which the reputation of England does not stand high. But one asks
at once--What in fact did his diplomacy achieve? And, diplomacy
apart, the great upheaval which issued in the Reformation was in full
activity when Wolsey was at the height of his power and influence. The
master-mind of his age therefore could hardly have failed to leave his
mark on the Reformation. What did Wolsey accomplish--nay, what did he
even attempt to accomplish--in that connexion?


II

CARDINALIS PACIFICATOR

Thomas Wolsey was born probably in 1471. His father was a citizen of
Norwich--a grazier. The popular voice calls him a butcher. The boy was
sent very young to Oxford, taking his degree when he was only fourteen
years old, and otherwise achieving high distinction. At Magdalen he
remained, fulfilling various college functions till the end of 1499.
Before that date, John Colet, five years his senior, had commenced his
famous course of lectures, introducing a new style of scholarship and
a new type of biblical criticism. Thomas More, seven years his junior,
had finished his University career. Erasmus had paid Oxford a flying
visit. There is no trace of any personal association between Wolsey and
these lights of the new school: yet there is no doubt whatever that
as an educationist he was in close sympathy with them. The facts are
therefore the more significant of some incompatibility of temperament:
for we should naturally have expected scholars, agreed upon an
innovating theory, to have been drawn together.

Acting at this time in a tutorial capacity to the sons of the
Marquess of Dorset, Wolsey was rewarded by a living at Limington: and
the ex-bursar of Magdalen was in a very short time a quite notable
pluralist, and in close personal relations with various important
personages, culminating in his appointment as Chaplain to Henry VII.
in 1506. The king, whose only living rival in diplomatic astuteness
was Ferdinand of Spain, was prompt to discern the kindred abilities of
his new servant, who within a year or two was successfully employed to
carry through important negotiations both in Flanders and in Scotland.

In April 1509 the old king died. His successor was hailed with
acclamation on all hands. Of splendid physique, and glowing with
martial ardour as was natural in a healthy boy of eighteen, the
military section of society saw in him promise of a revival of the
glories of Agincourt. The scholars too claimed their part in him,
as he joyously claimed fellowship with them. The populace shouted
applause when the detested Empson and Dudley were sent to the block.
The veterans who occupied the chief thrones of Europe dreamed that the
innocent youth would be to them as clay in the hands of the potter.
Every one was satisfied.

For a little while all went merrily. The English nobles thirsted
for war with France: Ferdinand and Maximilian had no difficulty in
persuading the young monarch that in alliance with them he might
achieve the laurels for which he hankered. He was to begin the
fighting, they were to play at supporting him, and if by good luck
something more substantial than laurels should be achieved, that of
course would go to his partners.

Wolsey’s old pupil the Marquess of Dorset was sent to Spain in command
of the expedition which was to begin the war, with the conquest of
Guienne in view. Dorset’s army wanted beer: they could only get wine,
which they considered thin. In effect they went on strike, and insisted
on coming home again. The marquess brought them back ignominiously,
without so much as a laurel-leaf.

Fox, Bishop of Winchester, perhaps the best of the old king’s surviving
ministers, had been pressed into the background by the warlike nobles;
but he had succeeded in introducing into the Council the man who was
to sweep the nobles themselves into the background. Wolsey was nobody
in particular, but he was a very clever man with immense organising
ability and an infinite capacity for detail and for hard work. The
fiasco was not repeated. In 1513, the army of invasion went to its
proper field, Picardy. It was not a haphazard picnic party, and it
captured Terouenne and Tournai. In the meantime, Surrey was shattering
the Scots army at Flodden. A few months later, Henry had discovered
that Ferdinand and Maximilian were using him as a cat’s-paw. Again a
few months passed, and Wolsey had beaten them at their own game. France
and England were in alliance. Then the uncontrollable changed the face
of things. King Louis died: Francis I. succeeded. But the brief dream
of the old kings had been finally dissipated: Henry was going to be
nobody’s cats-paw. He had found a minister more than worthy to follow
in his father’s footsteps.

In 1515 Wolsey was fully established not as the king’s chief adviser,
but in effect as his sole minister. In 1513 he was not yet guiding
the king’s policy: his work was mainly administrative. In 1514
the distinctive principle of his policy comes into full play. The
anti-Gallic theory is discarded. Thenceforth, the hand of England is
not against any Power in particular. As Foreign Minister, Wolsey’s
business is to see that the balance of power is maintained; that no
one prince shall be too far aggrandised; that each of them shall be a
check on the aggression of others; that all shall maintain a habitual
attitude of concession to England for the sake of her support; and that
this is to be effected without involving England in actual warfare.
Ferdinand dies in 1516; Maximilian in 1519. Charles V. succeeds both to
Spain and to the Empire. In the latter year, the destinies of Europe
are in the hands of three monarchs not one of whom is thirty years
old. Wolsey during the following years remains in effect the arbiter
of Europe till his hand is forced by Henry, and he finds himself
compelled to overt hostility with France. After the disaster of Pavia,
the blunder becomes manifest; his own policy is again allowed free
play, and the old domination is all but recovered when the affair of
the divorce wipes all other questions out of the field. The king’s
will must be carried out at all costs. Failing therein, the Cardinal
falls--irretrievably.

Two leading facts emerge. First: so long as Wolsey is allowed a free
hand to carry out his own policy, he does it with complete success.
Second: if the king elects to lay down a different policy, the Cardinal
has to carry that policy through as best he may. The idea that he ruled
the king is entirely fallacious. For some years, the king had the
wisdom to recognise that his minister’s views were sound. Then his
anti-Gallic leanings dominated him. Then he perceived his error, and
reverted to his minister’s policy; till again a purely personal motive
intervened, and policy again went to the winds. Since the personal
motive could not be satisfied without a revolution, Henry conducted
the revolution himself. The _rôle_ the king required of his minister
was one demanding other abilities than those of the Cardinal, and the
Cardinal was thrown to the wolves.

Effectively then it is true to say that while Wolsey held sway in
England, he was the arbiter of Europe. Whether it was for the good
of England that she should concern herself with being the arbiter of
Europe is another matter. It may be argued that the less she has to do
with Europe the better for her. But the theory of splendid isolation
for Great Britain is not the same thing as that theory applied to
England when Scotland was an independent nation in habitual alliance
with France, and always ready for hostilities. Even after Flodden the
menace on the Northern Border had to be taken into perpetual count.
Moreover, the advocates of that doctrine must still recognise that the
opposite view is legitimately maintainable; and it follows that the
statesman who, acting on the opposite view, successfully upheld English
predominance without plunging the country into sanguinary wars, is
entitled to a very high meed of praise.

Yet this does not express the whole of Wolsey’s achievement: for, when
he began to guide England’s policy, he had to win position for her,
not merely to maintain a position already held--a hard enough task
in itself. To say that she was no more than a third or fourth-rate
Power is an exaggeration. It was true in 1485: it had ceased to be
true in 1500. Long before the close of his reign, the first Tudor had
made himself a person of very considerable importance, whom none of
the continental Powers dreamed of ignoring, and with whom they treated
on something very like equal terms. This, however, was in no small
degree a matter of personal prestige. Henry’s reputation for astuteness
stood so high, not to speak of his credit for accumulated wealth, that
the Courts of the continent paid England’s king an amount of respect
which they would not have rendered to the power of England. With the
removal of his personality, England dropped to a lower plane, but
certainly did not become a negligeable quantity. If there was a brief
disposition to regard her not as negligeable but as futile, that was
due merely to the hastily formed conclusion that the young king was
a tender innocent. The old Henry’s position was recovered the moment
that Wolsey’s abilities were recognised. The marriage of the young
princess Mary to the old King of France in 1514, was precisely the kind
of stroke which Henry VII. would have made. It marked the fact that in
any leagues or combinations which foreign princes might contemplate, an
England thoroughly alive to her own interests, and thoroughly capable
of safe-guarding them, must be reckoned with. In producing this result,
Wolsey’s administrative ability as well as his diplomatic skill had
played no small part; since to that was owing, in a great degree, the
successes which attended the English arms in 1513; successes which were
effective reminders that what English troops had done before they might
learn to do again.

So far, however, what Wolsey had done was little if at all more than
to restore the position of 1508; though this was accompanied by a
suggestion that English interference in Continental affairs might be
of a less purely defensive order than it had been under the late king.
The suggestion was very soon to be turned into fact; and for some
years kings and emperors and popes were to find that, whatever designs
they might have in hand, they would have no chance of carrying them
out beyond the point which Wolsey might be induced to sanction. The
distinguishing feature of Wolsey’s method was his reliance on purely
diplomatic action, to which end he had the aid of a particularly
capable subordinate in Richard Pace. The Cardinal habitually posed as
an arbitrator, composing the differences of Christendom and maintaining
that general peace which it was theoretically the special function of
the Roman Pontiff to secure.

For Ferdinand of Aragon, the leading idea was always to find an ally
who could be inveigled into doing his fighting for him without any
return. For Maximilian, the leading idea was to find an ally who would
subsidise him to do the fighting while he could evade his own part of
the bargain. Wolsey, by his alliance with Louis XII., turned the tables
on both of them. The alliance itself was practically terminated by the
accession of Francis in January 1515. France reaped the immediate
profit, for neither Spain nor the emperor would risk a course which
depended for success on a mutual fulfilment of obligations. Ferdinand
became friendly to Francis, but without any intention of giving him
effective support. When the latter’s progress in Italy seemed likely
to be too rapid, Wolsey entered into relations with Maximilian which
served as a check on Francis without filling the emperor’s purse. When
Ferdinand died, Charles, his successor, was only sixteen, and though
his counsellors were well disposed to France, being mainly Flemings,
there was no present prospect of vigorous intervention on his behalf.
Active hostility on the part of England would be dangerous, and when
Maximilian in turn died, both Charles and Francis were suitors for the
favour of the supreme minister in England. The turn of the wheel had
made them inevitable rivals. The imperial election went in favour of
Charles, that being less dangerous than the success of Francis would
have been, and it was now Wolsey’s policy to hold the balance between
the two. An era of universal peace was inaugurated; Charles and Francis
did not join in formal alliance, but England united with each of them.


III

WOLSEY AND THE FRENCH WAR

The inauguration of an era of universal peace is usually the prelude
to a war. A year after the Field of the Cloth of Gold, Charles and
Francis were on the verge of hostilities. Wolsey negotiated with both,
ostensibly to bring about an accord. But in fact, England was committed
to support Charles: and the responsibility was with the Cardinal.

The conclusion to which the circumstances point is that the pressure
was too great for him to resist. Popular sentiment in England was
opposed to the French alliance. The queen was a warm adherent of her
young kinsman. The king was personally jealous of the achievements
of Francis, and had visions of the French crown or at least of the
recovery of Guienne. Wolsey probably felt that if he tried to maintain
his own policy he would alienate Henry, and if he alienated Henry--who
had just annihilated Buckingham--he would meet Buckingham’s fate amid
universal applause, and the anti-French policy would triumph in any
case. He elected to carry out the anti-French policy and remain at the
helm. Hostile critics would suggest that he was actuated by the desire
of obtaining the support of the emperor when the Papacy should become
vacant. Charles failed to keep his promise when Leo died, and gave his
support to another candidate; but neither then nor in the following
year when Clement VII. was elected--again with the support of
Charles--did Wolsey show any sign of changing his policy in consequence.

The English people had wanted the war; when they got it they paid for
it at first cheerfully. But no advantage accrued, not even appreciable
glory, and they tired of it. After Pavia, Henry thought the opportunity
had come to strike for the French crown; but such an effort demanded
more money. The business of getting it of course devolved on the
Cardinal. There was no hope of obtaining it legitimately from a
Parliament; Wolsey tried illegitimate methods--and failed. There was
no alternative but to drop the war policy. Wolsey made an advantageous
peace, and Charles promptly found himself obliged to come to terms with
Francis. But it is clear that from this moment Wolsey’s position with
his master became painfully uncertain.

Here then is the practical termination of Wolsey’s great period.
After this, the king is absorbed by the divorce, and the minister,
willy-nilly, must devote himself to that object--his own ruin being
the alternative. His diplomatic labours achieved no permanent result,
because the position won for England could only be maintained by
continuity of diplomatic effort and diplomatic skill. After her own
very different fashion, Elizabeth fifty years later was balancing
continental forces, and manipulating them to her own ends, in a manner
much less impressive and often indeed singularly undignified, but
certainly not less successful. And with her, the result was that the
England which Philip of Spain had hoped to make an appanage of his
own established herself as the indisputable mistress of the seas. The
change in the relative position of England between 1558 and 1588 was
far greater than between 1508 and 1528.

But Elizabeth worked with a perfectly free hand. Wolsey worked for a
master, who was quite capable of wrecking the minister’s schemes for
a purely personal end. He had to persuade that master to sanction
a policy which he never adopted with enthusiasm. He had to carry
it through in spite of the hostility of the governing classes, the
ill-will of the queen--who was still on terms of accord with her
husband--and his own extreme unpopularity with the mob. That is, he
had to work single-handed amidst extremely adverse conditions; and all
the circumstances being taken together, it may fairly be said that he
displayed a diplomatic genius unique among English statesmen.


IV

DOMESTIC POLICY

In the field of foreign affairs Wolsey’s policy and his methods were
both derived from Henry VII.: or perhaps it would be more accurate to
say he applied the same methods to a development of the same policy.
The invaluable make-weight was converted into the inevitable arbiter:
the means, a process of peaceful bargain-driving. The bargains were
usually in both cases profitable for England. Incidentally, they
generally contained unwritten clauses which were profitable also to the
Cardinal. There is no reason to suppose that any case occurred in which
Wolsey permitted essentials to be in the slightest degree affected by
considerations of his own gain. But he himself would never have thought
of disputing that he accumulated great profits out of his diplomatic
transactions.

The first objective then of Wolsey’s policy was the establishment of
England not merely as an important factor but as the dominant factor
in European politics: therein going beyond anything that Henry VII.
had contemplated, but still acting on lines laid down by him. In his
second objective, he was still a disciple of the old king. This was the
establishment of the Crown as a practical autocracy.

The primary condition of an absolutist government was a full treasury;
and here Wolsey had the immense advantage of the great hoards
accumulated during the last reign. In spite of the heavy expenditure
involved in ministering to the king’s pleasures, and on such pageantry
as the Field of the Cloth of Gold, government in Wolsey’s hands was
economically conducted. The great revenues which fell into his own
hands not merely from the numerous preferments he held in England,
but also from foreign sources, enabled him to defray the magnificence
of his own establishment, public as well as private: and there were
indirect methods of throwing much of the cost of the Court upon private
persons. It was not till 1523 that the Cardinal found himself forced
to look to the country for supplies by the necessities of a war budget.
For very nearly ten years he had carried on the government without
calling Parliament, although it had hardly been summoned during the
preceding decade; under a continuance of the same _régime_, England
might have become accustomed to doing almost without Parliament.

The second principle in establishing absolutism was the further
depression of the nobility, who--again, as in the days of Henry
VII.--were steadily kept from offices of State. Even the Howards
exercised no control; and the most powerful of all, the Duke of
Buckingham, was suddenly brought to the block. In that, as in
everything the king did that was unpopular, the minister was charged
with being the moving spirit, and his determination to destroy all
rivals was accounted the moving cause. As a matter of fact, the duke’s
execution fitted in with the Cardinal’s policy: but there is no direct
ground for supposing that he had any active share in the matter. On the
whole, there is no evidence that he was particularly vindictive. Still,
personal ambition apart, since none of the nobles would willingly
have been associated with him as a colleague it was necessary to the
carrying out of his policy that his rivals should have their talons
pared as far as possible; and also of course that there should be none
powerful enough to form a disaffected party. Wolsey knew that, except
for one or two ecclesiastics who had already in effect retired from the
political arena, he stood practically alone. He had to make himself
necessary to the king, and, since he could not be loved by the nobles,
it undoubtedly suited him that they should fear him. In the result he
succeeded so completely in destroying all possibility of opposition to
Henry’s will that there was no man in the kingdom whom the king could
not destroy if he chose merely to raise a finger.

Successful as he was in building up the power of the Crown, he was
still apparently at the height of his own influence when he learnt
that the power of the purse still lay elsewhere; and the king learnt
a very important lesson at the same time--a lesson which he was to
turn to account before very long--the importance of conciliating
popular sentiment. Money was needed for the French war. Wolsey would
have treated the Parliament, called to provide it, as a mere passive
instrument for carrying out the royal behest. Had the House of Commons
in 1523 suffered itself to be brow-beaten, it would have virtually
surrendered its place in the Constitution. The House refused to be
brow-beaten: it refused point-blank to discuss or to vote in the
Cardinal’s presence. When he retired in wrath, a substantial sum was
voted, but as a free grant to the king, not obligatory. Two years
later, more money was wanted. Wolsey did not dare to ask a Parliament
for it. He resorted to Benevolences, and found the citizens of London
obstinate in their assertion that Benevolences were illegal. However
willing Parliaments or burgesses might be to leave measures to the king
and his minister, they were absolutely determined to provide nothing
out of their own pockets unless their own consent had first been
obtained through strictly constitutional channels.

In this thing Henry was quick to prove himself shrewder than the
Cardinal. Like his daughter after him, he had an intuitive perception
of the national temper, and lost no time in repudiating the idea of
coercion. His personal popularity was doubled, and all the odium for
the attempt fell upon the minister. But the scheme towards which he was
strongly predisposed had been foiled, and Wolsey, though the result
favoured his own views, knew that it would be fatal to him if he failed
a second time to give effect to the king’s desires.

Therefore the Cardinal now gave himself up to the effort to meet his
master’s demands in the matter on which he had set his heart, the
separation from Katharine. But in this one matter, success for him was
sufficiently improbable from the outset, and as time went on events
which he was wholly unable to control made it a sheer impossibility. He
failed, and the failure spelt his ruin. Giving himself utterly to the
king’s service, his compliance did not save him. Hitherto he had been
a statesman, pursuing ends which certainly magnified both his country
and his sovereign with extraordinary ability and amazing success, by
methods certainly not more unscrupulous than were sanctioned by the
universal practice of the time. Now he devoted himself to an object
wholly unworthy, which he must have felt to be utterly unrighteous. The
king for whom he degraded himself served him--characteristically. Did
the fallen man feel that his punishment was just, even while the hand
that dealt it was supremely unjust? It would seem so. The sentiment, if
not the words, which Shakespeare put in his mouth is authentic:

                    O Cromwell, Cromwell!
    Had I but served my God with half the zeal
    I served my king, he would not in mine age
    Have left me naked to mine enemies.


V

THE DIVORCE

The whole story of the divorce is an ugly one; no amount of sophistry
will ever make it anything else. Mr. Froude succeeded in persuading
himself that pure unsullied patriotism was Henry’s ruling motive: and
brings himself, apparently with some difficulty, to grant a qualified
pardon to Katharine for her resistance, on the ground that after all
she was a woman, and weak. If Henry had acted as some others have done,
and had taken up definitely the position that by hook or by crook the
legalisation of a new marriage for him was a national necessity, in
order that a male heir to the throne might be born, the issue would
have been a plain one. If bigamy could be justified on the grounds of
national expediency, there was a decently good case for authorising
a bigamous union. To provide a technical trick for evading the form
of bigamy would no doubt have made the process easier, not affecting
the ethics of it one way or other. But it followed logically that
national interests alone were first to be taken into consideration in
the selection of the new spouse. The fact that in that choice Henry was
guided by passion and no other consideration whatever is sufficient
proof that the actuating motive with him was not _salus populi suprema
lex_. The grotesque nemesis by which later on Henry found himself with
three acknowledged children of his body of whom two were born in what
was supposed to be wedlock, both in virtue of marriages which the
Courts had subsequently declared void, while the third, a boy, had no
pretensions to legitimate birth--that nemesis is really a _reductio ad
absurdum_ of the whole position.

If on the other hand the awakening of Henry’s conscientious scruples
had not coincided with a violent passion for another woman it would
have been easier to believe that they were genuine, and that all he
really wanted--as he frequently affirmed--was to have those scruples
allayed. A genuine doubt would assuredly have demanded an authoritative
pronouncement. Unfortunately, he made it perfectly clear that no
authority could allay the scruples; he was absolutely determined that
the Pope and the Cardinal between them must see to it that the doubts
should be confirmed.

The precise stage at which Henry discovered that the weal of his people
required a male heir of his body at any cost; at which his conscience
began to question the validity of the dispensation under which he had
married Katharine; at which he determined that Anne Boleyn should
supplant the queen: all these are matter of some doubt. It is fairly
clear that in 1526--certainly in 1527--if not before, Wolsey had been
made aware that the king was desirous of exchanging Katharine for Anne;
that Wolsey on his knees entreated the king to think better of it; that
he found the king obdurate. There is no sign at all that the ethics of
the divorce troubled Wolsey in any way; on the other hand no one has
ever questioned that the Boleyn marriage was a thing hateful to him
from every point of view. But he had to choose between lending himself
to the king’s desire and rushing on his own ruin. Perhaps there are
not many men who would have dared to take the nobler course; Wolsey,
_deteriora secutus_, none the less fell.

It would seem that Wolsey first set himself to discover some legal
expedient for nullifying the marriage, hit upon the idea that the
dispensation granted by Julius was invalid, and tried more than one
scheme with a view to its being pronounced invalid--hoping, it may
be, that the law’s delays would give the king time to get over his
infatuation for Anne, and that when--if ever--he should be legally free
to take a new wife, the new wife would be a more fitting person.

First of all then, Wolsey, as Papal Legate, took steps for holding a
Legatine Court in England before which the issue should be tried. But
this plan contained a material flaw. Katharine might appeal to the
Pope against the decision of the Legatine Court, and Wolsey, in the
event of such appeal, would become a mere party in the suit instead
of a judge. The Pope therefore must be induced either to give a
favourable pronouncement on his own account, or to appoint a Legatine
Court _ad hoc_--a Court whose judgment would be final. A very difficult
matter; for precisely at this time the recent misfortunes of France
were bearing their fruit: the emperor became entirely predominant in
Italy, and obtained complete control of Clement--and the emperor was
Katharine’s most affectionate nephew. So the hapless Pope, who was
very anxious to keep friends with Henry but was naturally even more
anxious not to offend Charles, desired above everything to evade giving
a decision himself. On the other hand, Wolsey felt that there must be
no pretext for subsequently questioning the legality of the process
by which the dispensation was to be quashed, and therefore it was
imperative that in form that process should convey the Papal sanction.
Besides this, he had a very powerful personal reason for insisting on
it. In England the Boleyn connection, who knew perfectly well what were
Wolsey’s views about Anne, were working hard and not without success
to destroy the king’s trust in the Cardinal, who saw his influence
tottering. Failure to procure the divorce would certainly mean for him
destruction; success, followed by the Boleyn marriage, would place more
power in the hands of the most hostile faction, and he would be left
absolutely alone to bear the whole obloquy of an extremely unpopular
measure, unless the ultimate responsibility could be forced on the
reluctant Pope.

As far as Wolsey was concerned, Clement won the game after apparently
yielding. A Legatine Commission was appointed, but Campeggio was
associated with Wolsey as judge: he managed to spend the best part
of a year in reaching England; it was in fact fifteen months after
the appointment that the Court began its sittings. A few weeks later,
the Pope revoked the case to Rome. For all practical purposes, the
revocation sealed the Cardinal’s fate.

For two years past Wolsey’s position, for all that it seemed to the
world so assured, had been extremely precarious. The king had sent
one agent to Rome behind his minister’s back. The agent’s mission
failed ignominiously, but the thing was significant. Wolsey had gone
to France on a diplomatic errand; on his return, instead of being
summoned to a confidential meeting with the king, he found Anne Boleyn
in the presence. He had been soundly rated by the king because, in
appointing an abbess to Wilton, he had rejected a most unsuitable
_protégée_ of the Boleyns. He knew the stake for which he was playing:
he can hardly have doubted, from the beginning of what was called “The
King’s Affair,” that his fate was bound up with success or failure.
The illusion that he ruled the king was one from which it does not
appear that he ever suffered himself. All he did was to rule England
and English policy precisely so long as he retained the personal
favour of the king, and his policy did not clash with any of the royal
predilections.

In this matter of the “divorce,” Wolsey has found an earnest apologist
in Father Taunton. In his view, it would seem that the Cardinal was
justified, because he believed that there really was a technical flaw
in the form of the dispensation as granted by Pope Julius: if there
was such a flaw, the king was entitled to the benefit of it: and its
existence would enable the Pope to quash the dispensation, without so
much as raising the question whether the granting of it at all was
_ultra vires_ for any Pope. Now the ingenuity of the lawyer who wins
his client’s case on a technical quibble may be admired--in a way: the
ingenuity of the ecclesiastic, who would have provided the Pope with a
golden bridge for evading an awkward question, is also to be admired.
But in presenting these grounds for admiration, the last possibility of
a _moral_ defence is given away. Persons honestly believing that the
relation between Henry and Katharine was by the moral law incestuous,
and could not be otherwise, despite any possible Papal dispensation,
were entitled to urge the dissolution of their union. But if that
relation was not inherently immoral, and was capable of being made
legal as well, then the barest sense of justice demanded, that no
dubious point of law should be brought in, in order to engineer a
dissolution.

The whole case for Wolsey, according to Father Taunton, rests precisely
on this very dubious point of law. The dispensation was formally
drawn to make the marriage between Henry and Katharine lawful even
if affinity had been contracted. But in the ordinary course, as the
law stood, a woman being not married but fully betrothed to a man
might not--although no actual marriage had taken place--marry that
man’s brother, her doing so being against “public honesty.” Since the
greater includes the less, and the whole includes the part, it would
seem obvious that a dispensation covering the actual marriage _ipso
facto_ covered the pre-contract. Yet the apologist would have it that
the Cardinal was satisfied to rest the _whole_ case for nullifying the
marriage on the position that the dispensation was technically invalid
because it did not specifically refer to “public honesty” as well as to
affinity. Such was the contemptible quibble by which the “master-mind
of his age” was prepared to procure a pronouncement that Katharine was
no wife--so that the Papacy might escape an awkward dilemma.

It is at least intelligible to maintain that circumstances may arise
under which, for the public safety, flagrant injustice towards an
individual may be and ought to be committed. That is undoubtedly the
feeling at the bottom of Mr. Froude’s argument. Possibly also it was
at the back of Father Taunton’s mind; but he does not put it forward.
If the doctrine itself be admitted, a loyal son of the Roman Church
is perhaps entitled to hold that it was right to sacrifice Katharine
in order to avoid raising a question extremely inconvenient to the
Papacy. Perhaps also that view is the excuse least derogatory to Wolsey
which can be offered. A review, however, of the entire context of the
documents which Father Taunton cites in part points rather to the
conclusion that the Cardinal did mean to argue that--dispensation or
no dispensation--affinity was an absolute bar; and intended to fall
back on the quibble only as a last desperate resort if the contraction
of affinity were disproved; that he at least wished to find the moral
ground for nullity maintained, but, if that should prove impossible,
was prepared to surrender the extreme Papal claim.

The view of the whole business resulting from a consideration of all
the facts so far as they can be certainly ascertained is entirely
consistent with the rest of the Cardinal’s career. Ambition made him
desire power; like other men of great intellect and strong will, he
knew himself fitted to hold it; like many other statesmen, and with
a good deal more reason than some, he imagined himself the only safe
guide for the State; and he knew that if he once fell there would
be for him no recovery. About 1526, when for a dozen years he had
been the greatest figure in the eyes of the Western world, he found
himself presented with a dilemma. He must execute the king’s will in a
particular matter--or fall.

The king’s will would at least serve the State well in one respect if
it issued in providing a male heir to the throne. Also, if the marriage
were really contrary to the moral law and outside the dispensing power,
it would be in the interest of public morals that the fact should be
declared. So far, no one could possibly be blamed for maintaining the
king’s case. That was the line subsequently taken by Cranmer. But
for Wolsey the situation was much more difficult than for Cranmer,
because for Wolsey it was a _sine qua non_ that the Pope’s official
authority should be maintained. He could not, therefore, adopt any
course which ignored that authority even so far as by not requiring its
open sanction: much less could he, like Cranmer, defy it. Whether, for
the sake of preserving that authority the more rigidly, he intended
to ignore the one moral defence for the desired measure and content
himself with pleading a legal quibble, is a question that can be
argued; but it is quite clear that he was prepared to do so in the last
resort. In short, if the only way to avoid his own downfall was by
sacrificing an innocent victim, the innocence of the victim should not
save her. He would have preferred, no doubt, that the sacrifice should
not be made, but, under the circumstances, he did not hesitate. His
moral plane was too conventionally low for the alternative course. More
or Fisher would have acted otherwise. But the successful statesman who
is ready to commit political suicide rather than actively participate
in an unrighteous deed which he cannot prevent, is not often to be
met with. And Wolsey had the further excuse that he hoped to save
the Church, as he conceived it, from the disastrous results which he
foresaw if the matter fell into other hands.


VI

WOLSEY AND THE REFORMATION

From the attitude of Wolsey to the Papacy in the matter of the divorce,
we are naturally led to a consideration of his whole position in
matters ecclesiastical and religious.

The great revolution which we call the Reformation had two main
aspects. Employing the term “the Church” as representing not the whole
body of professing Christians but the clerical organisation: the
Reformation in the first place changed everywhere, though in varying
degrees, the relation of the secular governments to the Church within
their borders; in the second place it changed the relations of the
various geographical sections of the Church to the whole Catholic body
of which they were members. Thus the State in England assumed a new
attitude to the Church in England, and the Church in England as well as
the State was placed in a new relation to the Roman pontificate. These
changes were essentially political.

In its second aspect, the Reformation was a religious revolution; a
revision of ethical standards; a revival of that ardour of sentiment
and of conviction whereof martyrs are born; a spiritual movement,
accompanied by a doctrinal upheaval. That portion of Christendom which
adhered to the Roman pontificate, confining its doctrinal modifications
within the limits set by the Council of Trent, arrogated to itself
the title of Catholic. The rest arrogated to themselves the title
of the Reformed Churches, accepting the general label of Protestants
originally appropriate only to the Lutheran section. Like all political
labels, all three of these terms were incorrect, “Protestant” being
improperly extended, while the “Reformed” Churches might be Catholic,
and the “Catholic” Church was itself reformed. Perhaps it would be of
advantage rather to treat the doctrinal Reformation as a third aspect,
and to distinguish the great actors by the parts they played in the
political, the religious, and the doctrinal Reformations respectively,
whether in restraining or in promoting change. Thus, religion did not
enter into the programme of Henry VIII.; as to doctrine he certainly
was not a reformer; politically, he emerged as a revolutionary. Men
like More and Colet were ardent reformers of religion; in theology and
on the political side, they were conservative. Luther, Calvin and Knox
were of the advanced party in each case. But it must be definitely laid
down that of the three aspects of the Reformation the most vital was
the religious, not the political or the theological; and the men who,
whether Catholic or Protestant, were the religious leaders, are on a
higher plane of greatness than the rest; it is amongst them that we
must look for the “master-minds” of the age.

Now it does not appear that in any single one of these three aspects
Wolsey as a matter of fact influenced the great movement, already
fairly under weigh, in any appreciable degree. Had he, instead of
Clement, occupied the Papal throne, the political power of the Papacy
would indubitably have been for the time greatly advanced. Had his own
power in England survived the divorce business, the secular onslaught
on the ecclesiastical body conducted by Cromwell would not have taken
place. It is conceivable that under modified circumstances he might
have evolved a _modus vivendi_ for Church and State more favourable
to the Church than that which emerged from the thirty tempestuous
years which followed his death. But in fact the whole manner of the
Cardinal’s life, his immersion in secular politics, the magnificence
of his household, his many benefices, his vast accumulation of wealth,
the arrogance of his demeanour, typified and flaunted before the public
eye precisely those shortcomings of the clergy at large on which the
anti-clerical spirit of the laity was battening. The Cardinal might
have strengthened the Church’s power of resistance; he certainly was
in no small degree the cause of the animosity of her assailants. In
the eyes of the whole world, he was essentially a man of the world,
worldly; and in worldliness, far more than in the temptations of the
Flesh or the Devil, the best of the reformers found the Church’s
besetting sin.

No political skill, no state-craft, no loyalty to his order, could
have gone to the root of the matter by removing the moral grounds of
hostility to the ecclesiastical organisation. A moral enthusiasm of
which--to put it mildly--no hint whatever is to be found in the great
minister, was absolutely essential for any man who was either to
renovate the prestige of the clergy so that the people should follow
them or so to inspire the people that the clergy should follow the
popular movement. In England there arose no prophet, but for that
much-needed _rôle_ Wolsey was about as little fitted as any imaginable
leader.

Nevertheless, something he did and more he was willing to do. There
were specific grievances which up to a certain point he sought to
remedy. Without surrendering any of the privileges of his order, he
made in his own Legatine Courts a vast improvement on the practice of
the ordinary Ecclesiastical Courts. He did away with a considerable
number of small religious Houses whose condition was more or less of
a scandal. His visitations brought about improved discipline in many
of the larger Houses; some of his appointments, as to the Abbey at
Glastonbury, were notably admirable; in rejecting an unworthy abbess
for Wilton he braved the anger of the king at a time when he ran an
exceptionally heavy risk in doing so. Above all, he was fully alive
to the necessity of educating a new generation of clergy up to a high
standard; and to that end he created his great foundations of Ipswich
and Cardinal College (Christ Church), Oxford, carrying out on a much
more extensive scale what Dean Colet and Bishop Fox had set themselves
to do before him. His college was crippled and his school was wrecked
when he fell; but in this at least he deserves to be honoured by the
side of William of Wickham. Yet the name of William is hardly to be
coupled with those of Luther or Loyola. Wolsey was a real and sincere
patron of education; he had a sufficiently keen sense of order and
public decency to be a just judge and something of a disciplinarian;
but much more than this would have been required to make him a potent
moral force; and without being that he could not, even had he become
Pope, have affected the Reformation in a permanent manner, though he
might have modified its political course. He was the consummation
of the old school of political ecclesiastics. Probably he was never
so much as conscious that a moral revolution was in progress. What
he did know was that the political position of the Holy See, and of
the whole ecclesiastical system, was threatened, and his legatine
and Papal ambitions may fairly be attributed as much to a belief in
his own fitness to pilot the ship as to selfishly personal motives.
But the mere fact that, with the powers he did acquire and the vast
abilities he possessed, he yet accomplished practically nothing either
as a reformer or as a bulwark of the old order, is fairly conclusive
proof that he was neither the “greatest of English statesmen” nor “the
master-mind of his age.”


VII

WOLSEY’S FALL AND CHARACTER

The Legatine Court was suspended, and the question of the divorce
advoked to Rome, in July 1529. The signs of Wolsey’s doom were quick to
gather. His master practically ceased to hold personal communication
with him. It was evident, when writs for a Parliament were issued in
September, that the Cardinal was no longer directing the king: for he
had consistently aimed so far as possible at the suppression of the
functions of Parliament. Campeggio was hardly out of the country when
his colleague was indicted under the Statute of Præmunire for having
exercised the legatine office contrary to the law. The Dukes of Norfolk
and Suffolk deprived him of the Great Seal which he held as Chancellor.
Ill and despairing, he retired to his house at Esher, shorn of all
his offices. He was attainted in the House of Peers, and the Bill was
passed. In the Commons, however, the vigorous opposition to it made
by Cromwell, and a feeling that the king was not unfavourable to its
rejection, resulted in its being thrown out.

Probably Henry had not yet thoroughly made up his mind as to his course
of action, and wished to preserve a possibility of recalling his
minister to his counsels. He was told that he might be permitted to
discharge some of his pastoral functions, and was allowed to retire in
the spring to York, to take up the duties of the Archbishopric; and in
spite of the immense fines imposed on him, he was by no means stripped
bare of this world’s goods. York was fixed on as being more remote from
the neighbourhood both of Henry and of the Continent than Winchester.
He threw himself into the unaccustomed _rôle_ with apparent zest, and
seemed on the verge of achieving an unexpected reputation for pastoral
piety and devotion, when a fresh blow fell. He was summoned to London
on a charge of treason. He had been unwise enough to write to Francis I
and pray for his intercession with Henry; he was also accused, though
groundlessly, of having made really treasonous proposals to the Pope.
Already ill when he started, he became rapidly worse on his journey
south, and having reached the Abbey of Leicester, was unable again to
rise from his bed. There he passed away, pathetically forlorn; but at
least spared the last undeserved ignominy of a traitor’s doom.

On the high road to success and in the height of his power, Wolsey
extorts an admiration which is still somewhat reluctant. His figure
cannot be called attractive. Over the business of the divorce it is
difficult not to feel him positively repellent. But in his fall he rose
to moral heights of which his previous career gives no warning. What
shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
Here, it would seem, was one who--not voluntarily surrendering but
forcibly bereft of the world, when he had gained it--found thereby his
soul’s salvation. Through tears and tribulation, pain of the worn-out
body, anguish of the spirit, he won it. In the day of his triumph, his
countrymen hated him while they could not but admire; hated him with a
rare bitterness which made even Thomas More ungenerous; save some few
of his own household, none felt a touch of sympathy, unless perhaps the
king, who condescended to send him one or two kindly messages to salve
his own royal conscience while he was stripping his most loyal servant
of everything he possessed. Yet in the months of his retirement,
while, in his diocese of York, he devoted himself to the care of his
spiritual flock, the fallen Cardinal won on all hands a passionate
affection bestowed only upon men and women who can forget themselves in
their thought for others. At bottom there must have been in the man an
essential sweetness and loveableness repressed--dried up in the fires
of ambition, parched in the sunshine of prosperity, welling forth in
the shadow of adversity. Gone was the power that swayed the politics of
a continent; gone the gorgeous pomp, the insolent state, that stirred
the impotent malice of the lesser men he had overshadowed. But with
their loss, the hidden best that was in the fallen minister found free
play.

Wolsey’s chroniclers have been against him. Those who wished to
magnify the king pointed to the Cardinal as the evil genius who had
prompted every ill-judged deed. The nobility hated him as an insolent
and upstart foe to their order. Katharine’s party hated him, because
he was credited not only with anti-Spanish policy but with being the
prime mover of the divorce. The Boleyn party hated him, because they
knew that he loathed the Boleyn marriage. He had no sympathy from
the Protestants, since he stood for the old ecclesiastical order;
none from the later Catholics, since his attitude to the Papacy was
misunderstood; none from the populace, because he embodied the most
unpopular characteristics of ecclesiasticism. Even Cavendish, who
admired him, is careful in his record to point the moral that pride
goeth before a fall, lest his praise of the Cardinal’s demeanour in his
last year of life should be regarded as unduly laudatory. From Skelton
to Fox the martyrologist, every man had some motive for throwing a
stone at him.

But if Shakespeare--or another--has summed up for us the libels of his
enemies, the same hand has shaped the far truer eulogium pronounced by
the “honest chronicler” Griffith in the same play. By his own talents
he had made himself great: in his high station, if in some respects he
abused his power, yet in the main he worked for the glory of England.
It is inconceivable that when he fell, when the world slipped from
the grasp of one who had been the very type of worldliness, he should
have kissed the rod with perfect resignation, and found no taste of
bitterness in the cup allotted to him. Yet there was at least a solid
proportion of truth in the pious words of Griffith:

    His overthrow heaped happiness upon him;
    For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
    And found the blessedness of being little;
    And, to add greater honours to his age
    Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

No amount of historical inquiry will ever suffice to displace in the
public mind a portrait bearing Shakespeare’s signature. The Wolsey of
the play is not easy to reconcile with the Wolsey Griffith described
after his disappearance from the stage: but these words are still a
part of the Shakespearean portrait.




SIR THOMAS MORE


I

INTRODUCTORY

Reverence for tradition is not inconsistent with a belief in progress.
History yields us abundant instances of great minds which have combined
a keen appreciation of the ideas of liberty and equality with a strong
predilection in favour of time-honoured institutions. Sometimes, but
rarely, the conservative instinct predominates in youth, and gives
way to the liberal instinct as time goes on. Sometimes, not rarely,
the liberalism of youth yields to the conservatism of later life. In
either case, we are presented with the apparent paradox of the man who,
maintaining the complete consistency of his own career, is found to be
at one period of his life on the side of the reformers, and at another
period on the side of the reactionaries. When political movements are
comparatively slow, these paradoxes do not obtrude themselves: but when
revolutions are in the air, they become conspicuous. There are two eras
which are particularly fruitful in such phenomena; those, namely, of
the Reformation and of the French Revolution.

Each of those periods presents us in England with one political
thinker of the highest rank whose utterances before the great
change are cited in authority by progressives, while their later
pronouncements or actions are cited with approbation by the opposing
forces. There is nothing surprising about the change in political
attitude which unexpected events produce in a Stephen Gardiner or a
William Pitt; it is merely a divergence from the earlier course. But
Burke and More give a _prima facie_ impression of a complete reversal
of principle. “Miscalculation and inconsistency were the moving causes
of the vicissitudes of Thomas More’s career”; so Mr. Sidney Lee has
very recently written of him; as other critics have fallen back on the
theory that Burke’s intellect went to pieces. Both these great men
did, in fact, misinterpret the very startling events of which they
were witness, partly because actual facts was misrepresented to them.
Neither believed that a work-a-day world with established institutions
could be accommodated to ideal polities where those institutions had
never grown up. They had in practice to adapt their ideals to what they
saw as hard facts. Hence they condemned in the concrete what they would
have approved in the abstract. Yet both were close and acute reasoners,
and probably neither would have admitted for a moment that he had
deserted in later life a single principle which he had maintained at an
earlier stage.

But whether critics differ in their attempts to reconcile the More
who wrote the “Utopia” with the Lord Chancellor More, or give up the
attempt to explain the paradox as hopeless, the attractiveness and
nobility of the man stand unchallenged, as his intellectual eminence
is indisputable. It is impossible not to love and admire him. Of the
other nine men treated in this volume, all have apologists more or less
enthusiastic, but all have bitterly or contemptuously hostile critics.
More is one of the few men that have left their mark on our history,
who has won the tribute of universal affection and esteem.


II

UNDER HENRY VII

Thomas More was born in London in 1478, seven years after Thomas
Wolsey, and about the same length of time before Thomas Cromwell. There
is a rather curious prevalence of the name Thomas among prominent men
at this time, Cranmer being a fourth, and the youngest of the quartet.
More’s father was a barrister, who later became a judge; a gentleman
with a pleasant humour, a turn for economy, and conservative views.
John More was married thrice, and seems to have been comfortably wived,
being responsible for a witticism on the subject of matrimony such
as usually emanates from men whose personal experience contradicts
it. “Taking a wife,” said he, “is like putting your hand into a bag
containing a number of snakes and one eel. You _may_ lay hold of the
eel.” His son was not warned off the experiment, either by the jest or
by his experience of step-mothers.

Young Thomas was a lad of parts; his father was a person of distinction
in the great city. Morton, Archbishop and Lord Chancellor, and
subsequently a Cardinal, the wise counsellor of Henry VII. throughout
the first half of his reign, took the boy into his service, and
evidently found much satisfaction in cultivating and encouraging his
remarkable intelligence and wit; prophesying “marvellous things”
of him. The great man’s kindness was repaid by the very attractive
portrait which his _protégé_ has given us in the first book of the
“Utopia.” By Morton’s influence, Thomas, at fourteen, was sent to
Oxford--not an unusual age. Cranmer too was sent to Cambridge at
fourteen: while Wolsey’s youth was exceptional, for he took his degree
at the same age. More’s undergraduate career, however, was brief. He
was intended by his father to follow the profession of the law, and
John More took alarm when he found that his son was being beguiled into
an enthusiasm for the recently introduced study of Greek. There was
no connexion between law and Greek; besides, Greek was unsettling: it
seemed to put new-fangled and heterodox ideas into folk’s heads. So
after two years, More was withdrawn from Oxford, entered at New Inn
to study the law, and in February, 1496, was admitted a student at
Lincoln’s Inn: just about the time when John Colet was returning from
Italy.

There is every probability that Colet and his younger contemporary
had already foregathered at Oxford, in listening to the teaching of
Grocyn: otherwise it is not very easy to account for the warm intimacy
which arose between the Oxford Divinity Lecturer and the young student
of Lincoln’s Inn: though the fact that both their fathers were men of
such eminence in London, that the families may easily have been brought
into contact, must not be forgotten. In any case, the names of Colet,
Erasmus and More became closely associated between 1496 and 1500.
Erasmus paid a flying visit to England in 1498. Colet’s discourses were
already famous, and the Dutchman and the Englishman were introduced to
each other by Prior Charnock of the College of St. Mary the Virgin: to
their great mutual satisfaction. As the story runs, Colet told Erasmus
of the surprising genius of his young friend Thomas More, and told More
of the amazing endowments of his new acquaintance. The two, unknown
to each other, met at the same table, and fell into a dialectical
discussion which neither could resist; till at last the elder, putting
two and two together, exclaimed “Aut tu es Morus, aut nullus,” the
younger promptly responding “Aut tu es Erasmus, aut Diabolus.” Whether
the tale be true or not, the acquaintance was made, and ripened
rapidly into the warmest of friendships. In those days, complimentary
epithets between scholars were nearly as cheap and meant nearly as
little, as vituperative ones; but there is no mistake about the genuine
and spontaneous character of the terms in which Erasmus wrote to
and of Thomas More. He is always _dulcissimus_, _iucundissimus_, or
something equally endearing. Erasmus had superlatives for other people
too, but there is no one else on whom he lavishes the same wealth of
playful affection. It was to Robert Fisher that the scholar about
this time wrote his classic appreciation of his young friend--_Thomae
Mori ingenio quid unquam finxit natura vel mollius, vel dulcius, vel
felicius?_ “What hath nature ever fashioned more tender, more charming,
more happy, than the character of Thomas More?”

It was during this visit that More played a characteristic trick
on Erasmus, one which shows how well the quondam page of Cardinal
Morton (who had just entered on the last year of his life) stood in
distinguished quarters. Erasmus was staying at Greenwich with his
patron Lord Mountjoy. Thither came More, with a friend, to see him
and carry him off for a walk, in the course of which they came to a
handsome building, where More said he wished to pay his respects.
Somewhat to his dismay, Erasmus found on entering that they were
invading a royal domain, and that their visit was to Prince Henry and
his brother and sisters who wanted him there and then to produce them
a poem. He demurred, but was let off on condition of his promising to
send them one--a promise faithfully carried out.

More shared with his older friend a capacity for perceiving the
humorous side of things which stood him in good stead all his life. But
he had a deeper vein of seriousness, and to him--as to Colet--religion
meant a great deal more than it did to the cosmopolitan scholar. The
profession for which he was still training--he was not yet called
to the Bar--was one to which his abilities were eminently adapted,
and his intimacy with Colet did not prevent him from loyally devoting
his time and his studies to that training, as his father desired.
But as soon as he was duly called, he began to give his natural
predilections freer play, and we find him delivering in the City a
course of lectures on Augustine’s _De Civitate Dei_: to the admiration
of his old master Grocyn and others. Not, however, to the neglect of
his legal pursuits, for he was appointed Reader at Furnivall’s Inn;
or of larger ambitions, for, young as he was, he appeared as a member
of Henry VII.’s Parliament of 1504. The story of the “beardless boy”
persuading that assembly to reject a royal demand for cash, as told by
his son-in-law William Roper, is familiar; and even if not altogether
accurately reported, leaves no doubt that he did so offend Henry that
he felt it advisable to retire into political obscurity--the king
characteristically taking his revenge by extracting a fine from his
father.

It may have been this episode which gave him a temporary inclination to
betake himself to a monastic life: but this did not last. Investigation
did not lead to the conclusion that life in a monastery was quite the
same in practice as in theory, and a _penchant_ for asceticism could be
indulged without entering the cloister. Moreover, this summer Colet was
in London, probably to commence work at St. Paul’s, where he had just
been nominated to the Deanery; and Colet was not the man to counsel
such a step. On the contrary, he advised his friend to marry, and the
advice was taken next year.[B] The story is quaintly characteristic.
Visiting “one Mr. Colte a gentleman of Essex,” he was attracted by the
three daughters of the house. The second being the prettiest, took
his fancy, but he thought it would be hard on the elder sister if the
younger got a husband first, so he “of a certayne pittie framed his
fancie towardes her” instead--with excellent results.

      [B] Roper’s chronology is not very intelligible. He says
          that--after being called to the Bar--More was three
          years a Reader at Furnivall’s Inn, and then passed four
          years in the Charterhouse without taking the vows. The
          other evidence, however, points pretty conclusively to
          1505 as the date of his marriage.

On the whole it does not look as if More went in any very great fear
of the old king’s wrath. Mr. Colte would not have been in a hurry to
bestow his daughter in marriage on a young man whom Henry was seeking
occasion to slay: and probably More himself would have hesitated to
give hostages to fortune under those conditions.


III

THE EARLY YEARS OF HENRY VIII

Whatever reason he may have had to fear ill-will from Henry VII.--who
seldom wasted vindictive sentiments on people whose punishment could
not be substantially expressed in terms of hard cash--More could count
on the goodwill of his young successor. More than one of the princes of
those days ranked among the most accomplished men of their times; and
like his brother-in-law of Scotland, Henry would have more than held
his own in any company, intellectual or athletic. As yet, the world did
not know that his abilities were matched by a ruthless selfishness. He
seemed a brilliant and charming boy, frank-hearted and open-handed,
with just the carelessness becoming to his age: the very reverse of
the old king as men thought of him in his later years, sordid, crafty,
griping. The reign of Empsons and Dudleys was at an end; the approach
to the new king’s favour was to be through very different avenues. To
have been in the black books of Henry VII. was no reason for fearing
Henry VIII.

More prospered rapidly in his profession, and had no desire to be drawn
to Court or into the whirl of politics. He was very soon appointed to
the important office of Under-Sheriff in the City, and his private
practice was ere long bringing him a very substantial income. Also, to
his great satisfaction, the expectation of a more cheerful _régime_
in England was bringing Erasmus back again--there had been one flying
visit in the interval--to write the _Encomium Moriae_ under More’s
own roof, and still further to enrich and stimulate that congenial
intellectual society in which More himself had been living ever since
Colet had taken up his duties as Dean of St. Paul’s.

But however little ambitious More might be, his talents were too
conspicuous to permit of his being left alone. In 1515, the commercial
war with Flanders--an outcome of the foreign complications in which
Henry VIII. had become involved--was embarrassing both countries so
much that there was a strong desire for adjustment. An embassy was to
be sent, with Cuthbert Tunstall at its head. The merchants of London
desired to be represented; they wanted More to represent them; Wolsey,
now supreme, acceded; More was attached to the embassy, and the
abilities he displayed marked him out as a man fitted for the king’s
service. For a time More resisted; but his masterly conduct of a case
in which he was appointed as counsel for the Pope (in respect of a
ship which the Crown claimed as forfeit) caused Henry to put renewed
pressure on him. In 1518, he had become a courtier in his own despite.
This, by the way, may have some bearing on the fact that in that year
his father was elevated to the judicial Bench.

Some years earlier, More’s domestic life had suffered: his first wife
dying in 1512 and leaving him with four little children on his hands.
To provide the orphans with a mother, he took to himself a second wife,
some years older than himself; a kindly conventional soul, as it would
seem, who quite understood that her husband was a very clever man,
but was eternally puzzled by his disregard of worldly considerations,
and hopelessly confused by the whimsical irony with which he loved to
meet her “Tilly vally, Sir Thomas,” when he had been doing something
peculiarly exasperating from her point of view. She mothered his
children, and himself as much as he would let her; and never succeeded
in disturbing his humorous equanimity, though her own must have been
everlastingly ruffled.

The embassy to the Netherlands sealed More’s fate, by forcing him into
political life. It is also intimately associated with the one great
original literary work produced in England in the first half of the
sixteenth century: a work which established the fame of its author as
a political thinker of the highest rank, in spite of the intentionally
fantastic form in which it was cast.


IV

THE UTOPIA

Throughout More’s life, revolutionary forces had been at work in the
political, the intellectual, and the religious world; but as yet they
had not concentrated in any volcanic explosion. At present, More’s
most intimate associates stood in the very forefront of the most
advanced school, and his “Utopia” was to make his position beside
them as conspicuous to the world as it was assured in fact. He had
taken to Greek, in spite of his anxious parent, like a duck to water:
his affinity to the Platonic Socrates is obvious. John Colet was his
guide, philosopher and friend; and the downright reactionaries, like
the Bishop of London, had vain hankerings to suppress Colet as a
dangerous heretic. He was the chosen intellectual mate of Erasmus, who
had done or was doing more than any man living, to rid men’s minds
of the shackles of the old scholastic formalism. The grosser popular
superstitions, the worship of the letter and neglect of the spirit,
the pursuit of worldly advancement by the successors of the apostles,
were constant subjects for pulpit castigations by the one friend, and
the lively and scathing mockery of the other. The mediæval theory that
war is a pastime for the ambitions of princes was vigorously denounced
by both. In all these things More was with them heart and soul; and
he had already given audacious indication of his belief that the
function of government is to seek the good not of the governors but of
the governed, when he incurred the displeasure of Henry VII. in 1504.
This progressive attitude of mind found its complete expression in the
fantasy of Utopia.

The notion of constructing an imaginary Commonwealth under ideal
conditions on ideal lines was of course derived straight from Plato’s
Republic. That any existing State could be reformed into the semblance
of such a Commonwealth by the fiat of legislators, neither Plato nor
More ever dreamed. Neither the Republic nor the Utopia is in the
nature of one of those paper Constitutions whose devisers would fain
impose them in all their logical perfection upon recalcitrant nations.
They aim at setting forth those fundamental principles which must
indeed lie at the root of all healthy forms of government, but must
also inevitably materialise into different shapes under differing
conditions. The reproach that such schemes are not practical, which
is damning to a paper Constitution, is here wholly irrelevant. They
were never meant to be practical. Sir Galahad is not a practical model
for the British citizen, who would take warning from the career of the
Knight of La Mancha. Yet the conception of Sir Galahad is worthy of
serious contemplation by the British citizen, who may therefrom derive
not a little practical direction in the conduct of his life. To condemn
the presentation of avowed ideals as unpractical, is merely to display
a complete misapprehension of the meaning and use of ideals.

More, however, did not derive his method from Plato. The Athenian
started by looking for the logical principles on which a State should
be constructed, and built it, storey by storey. The Englishman imagined
his State already complete and expounded the finished structure; taking
example by other myths than the Republic. With happy ingenuity, he
made use of a suggestion from the records of the voyages of Amerigo
Vespucci to locate his dream-city in realms which some of that
eminent traveller’s company might have visited, alone of Europeans.
In similarly happy vein, he utilised his embassy to the Netherlands
to provide an introduction, the form of which was doubtless suggested
by Platonic precedent, though it is in no sense an imitation. The
characterisation of the persons whose conversation is reported is not
unworthy of the master.

The work is in two parts: the account of Utopia itself, and this
preliminary book, which introduces the traveller Hythloday, with his
criticisms on European politics in general, and the state of England
in particular. This, More would have us believe, is the way in which
a foreign Odysseus having “viewed the cities and marked the ways of
many a People” would judge the institutions on which the Englishman
prided himself. The suggestion that he wished to make himself safe
by attributing those criticisms to some one else is hardly tenable.
It does not appear that any one ever suspected Hythloday of having
had a more material existence than Lemuel Gulliver after him. The
intention is simply to dispose the reader’s mind so as to accept the
verisimilitude of what he knows to be a fiction; the intention of every
dramatic artist. Reason tells you that you are sitting in a theatre
and watching actors behind the footlights. Imagination tells you that
real events are going on before your eyes. If imagination fails,
tragedy becomes burlesque, and comedy silliness. The description of
Utopia appeals with tenfold force when your imagination accepts it as a
place which a real human traveller has seen; and the illusion is only
possible when the real human traveller has been convincingly presented.
Raphael Hythloday is as real as Robinson Crusoe. But there is no
reason to suppose that More wanted any one to think that Hythloday
had an address in Antwerp--as Peter Giles says, “Some ... for that
his minde and affection was altogether set and fixed upon Utopia, say
that he hathe taken his voyage thetherwards agayne.” “No-where land”
is the unsubstantial resting-place of the non-material but convincing
traveller.

Similarly, by putting his criticisms on English affairs into the
mouth of a foreign observer, from whose lips they come with a perfect
fitness, the artist procures for them an attention and consideration
which would be refused if they were being thought of as the criticisms
of an Englishman vilifying his own country. Again, the illusion is
needed only till the required effect is produced, namely, recognition
of the validity of the criticism.

The illusion is created with subtle skill. More relates how he was sent
on the Netherlands embassy, with various references to his associates,
and the actual facts of that episode in his career, and tells how
his (real) friend, Peter Giles of Antwerp, introduced the traveller
Hythloday--an interesting person who had voyaged to those lands of
which Europeans as yet knew exceedingly little and imagined an infinite
deal. More draws him out, and extracts from him his impression of
England, where he had visited Cardinal Morton, of the state of Europe
in general, and finally, by way of contrast, of that remote and unknown
State of Utopia, which has opened his eyes to what lies at the root
of so much that is unsatisfactory in the realms of Christendom. Thus
More is enabled to win interested attention to his own criticism of
the social and political conditions prevalent, and his own political
philosophy. Whatever the latter may be, the former is as practical as
possible.

The picture given of the world in which men were actually living and
moving, and pursuing their business or their pleasure, is vivid and
impressive. Moreover, its truth is borne out by all other evidence.
It is the work of a keen and humorous observer; and the analysis of
the causes of the pervading evils is unerring. It was no doubt wise of
More to antedate the description by a score or so of years, referring
it to Cardinal Morton’s days; but in 1515, every evil depicted had
become even more marked--and, it may be said, continued to increase
progressively until the reign of Elizabeth, the same causes continuing
to operate, with the addition of others which intensified the effects.
Every rising in the reigns of Henry VIII., of Edward VI., and of Mary,
whatever its ostensible ground, bears unmistakeable signs that the
agricultural depression with its attendant evils was a secondary, if
not the primary cause.

It would be too much to expect that the remedies More recommended
should have been equally above criticism. Economic science was in its
earliest infancy; in spite of experience, no one had begun to suspect
the inefficacy of legislation in certain directions, and there are
plenty of people who still believe that natural forces can be regulated
by statute. In no single respect was any thinker of his times in
advance of Sir Thomas More in these matters. But in many respects he
was in advance not only of the foremost of his contemporaries, but even
of current opinion and practice three hundred years later.

Thus, after describing the prevalence of thieving and robbery, he
points to idleness as its cause, but dwells emphatically on the
distinction between the idleness which is of choice and that which
is enforced by lack of employment. Half the thieves would be honest
labourers if they had the chance. The maintenance or development of
industries which provide employment would be an effective cure; but
instead of seeking a cure, the authorities fall back on punishment. But
the severity of the law, instead of checking the minor misdemeanours,
converts the pickpocket into a dangerous robber who--having no worse
penalty to fear for the graver offence--resorts to violence without
hesitation: so that the system regularly manufactures the worst
ruffianism.

The instability and disorganisation of industry produced by what
we now call “corners,” has its prototype in the “engrossing” and
“forestalling,” by which wealthy men make themselves monopolists. The
inevitable tendency of capital to flow in dividend-producing, not
philanthropic, channels, is foreshadowed by the steady conversion by
wealth-seeking landlords of arable land into sheep-runs; a process
which left much of the rural population without work, wages, food, or
home. Incidentally it may be noted that, while modern historians are
disposed rather to dwell on the substitution of greedy laymen for the
monasteries as landlords as one of the later causes of this particular
trouble, More expressly includes “certeyn abbottes, holy men no doubt,”
in his denunciation thereof. He may, however, mean no more than that
even the Church was not exempt from this reproach. In dealing with this
economic tendency for capital to seek the most lucrative channel, More
made the universal mistake of his day in believing that it could be
effectively restrained by Acts of Parliament.

In a vein no less practical, and no less opposed to the conventional
ideas of the time, and with a still more playful seriousness, the
traveller discourses of high politics and finance as they were debated
in the Cabinets of Europe, with the aggrandisement and enrichment of
monarchs as the one end in view. “‘This myne advyce, maister More,’
says he, ‘how think you it would be harde and taken?’ ‘So God helpe me,
not very thankefully’ quod I.’”

By this discussion, the way is prepared for Hythloday to favour his
company with an account of the remarkable polity which he found in
Utopia (a State as to the whereabouts of which More subsequently writes
in anxious inquiry to Peter Giles, who answers in the like vein of
pretended regret at being unable to answer the question). This account
occupies the second book, forming about two-thirds of the whole work.

In this fantasy, practicality vanishes at the outset. Such are the
defences, natural or artificial, of this most favoured island, that any
would-be invader is doomed to certain destruction, while the country
produces everything that man requires for comfort. It needs no army and
no navy, self-defence and self-assertion being equally superfluous: its
relations with foreign States are purely complimentary. The Utopians
make no foreign leagues. Where the bonds of goodwill are not sufficient
to maintain friendly relations, nations enter upon leagues, but only
to desert them at the first call of interest. Such is the strange
conviction of the Utopians, though they had not themselves experienced
the kaleidoscopic permutations and combinations of Ferdinand the
Catholic, Maximilian, Louis XII., Henry VII., Julius II., and the
Venetians. If by any chance they find it necessary to go to war, there
is a convenient breed of fighting men in a country not too far away,
who can always be hired for the purpose.

Being thus preserved from the creation of a military caste, while
universal education has prevented knowledge from being concentrated in
a priestly caste, it has been easy to prevent the development of any
sort of privileged class through the accumulation of private property,
which is prohibited. Hence, in Utopia, communism is practicable, and
the whole system is as a matter of course communistic, though the
principle is not extended to the relations between the sexes. Having
arrived at their religion not through the Christian Revelation, but
by Reason, any religious views are tolerated which are not manifestly
anti-social. It is a corollary of these conditions that government is
in the hands of elected magistrates, who have neither class interests
nor personal interests to deflect them from their proper function
of ruling with a single eye to the interests of the whole people.
The possibility that sectarian interests might have developed as a
disturbing factor does not seem to have presented itself; perhaps,
where no religious views might be aggressively expressed or repressed,
no strife of sects was to be feared.

In every direction, of course, the manners and customs of the Utopians
suggest that the manners and customs of the English are susceptible of
improvement. They take a philosophic view of the pleasures of life,
reckoning the gratification of animal appetites exceedingly low in
practice as well as in theory. They have no lust of gold and jewels.
They have no craving for display, for gambling, for the baser forms
of sport. On the other hand, they appreciate the value of sanitation.
There is no idleness, since every one is required to do his share of
work, but there is ample leisure for all; instead of one half of the
population having too much, and the other half too little, to do. Thus
they can enjoy in abundance those rational pleasures in which they take
a true delight, abiding in health and wealth.


V

MORE IN PUBLIC LIFE

It should be sufficiently clear that no one was more thoroughly aware
than Sir Thomas More himself that the Utopian conditions could not be
produced in a European State, and that Utopian institutions could only
exist under Utopian conditions. Of that fact he was destined to give
practical demonstration when called upon to discharge the functions of
a practical ruler.

In 1518 More became a Privy Councillor, and probably his influence
may be detected in the efforts, renewed about this time, to check
the conversion of arable land into pasture, and the evil practice of
enclosures. But Martin Luther’s activity was just beginning, and its
results were to make the contrast between Utopia and England even more
marked than previously. Before entering, however, on More’s attitude to
this new phase of the Reformation, we have to note some other points in
this stage of his career.

More stood in high favour. He had not climbed to a great position by
arduous effort; greatness, worthy of it as he was, had been thrust upon
him. His advancement was promoted by Wolsey, who was seldom vindictive
except towards rivals whose power might make them dangerous. In 1521
he was knighted. When Parliament was summoned in 1523 he was made
Speaker, by no means at his own desire, but chiefly at that of the
King and the Cardinal. The result was probably not quite what Wolsey
had anticipated. On his appointment, he had implied very clearly,
though in diplomatic terms, that he meant to uphold freedom of speech
in the House. But the business on hand was the voting of money, and
Wolsey made the mistake of attempting to overawe the Commons by coming
down to the House himself. The Members declined to speak or vote in
his presence; the Cardinal’s demands were received with dead silence.
Wolsey turned on the Speaker. The Speaker made it perfectly clear that
the House could not give way on the question of privilege. When Wolsey
withdrew, Parliament demonstrated its loyalty by making a substantial
grant.

According to More’s son-in-law, this incident brought More into the
black books of the Cardinal, who with ill intent tried to get him sent
on an embassy to Spain, under colour of complimenting him. If Wolsey
really meant evil by him, his designs came to nothing, for there was no
sign of any diminution in the royal favour. Already, however, in 1525,
Wolsey’s position was becoming precarious, though to all appearance
he was as dominant as ever. More’s next advancement was to the
Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1526; and from this time
Henry’s personal demands on his time and his society became exceedingly
pressing. A year later, the whole of the king’s real interest was
absorbed in the divorce question, which was to seal Wolsey’s fate
directly, and More’s indirectly. Henry consulted him about it, and More
then as always told his master honest truth--he did not see how the
marriage with Katharine could lawfully be voided. From that position
he never swerved. The king could respect conscientious scruples on the
part of a favourite, and did so as long as More remained a favourite.
More, however, had no illusions about the king’s constancy. “If my
head,” he told Roper, “would win him a castle in France, it should not
fail to go.” But when Henry decided that Wolsey could no longer serve
his turn, it was More whom he selected to fill the office of Lord
Chancellor, in spite of his views of the divorce.

During these years, the uprising of Luther had developed into a
widespread religious revolt. Henry, having no quarrel with Pope Leo,
and proud of his own attainments as a theologian, chose to enter the
lists for the demolition of Luther; producing an apologia for the
Papacy which earned him the title of “Defender of the Faith.” Before
publishing this work he showed it to More, who warned him, with shrewd
foresight, that, if ever he did come to have a quarrel with the Pope,
he would find it very difficult to get over his own argument, which
proved too much in support of Papal authority. Henry, however, would
not modify the view then expressed, and succeeded in satisfying his
counsellor that it was sound. In due course the prophecy came true:
Henry repudiated the position he had formerly defended. Unhappily for
More, however, the king had finally convinced him, and he declined to
surrender his conviction: with fatal consequences.

Viewed even exclusively as a religious movement, Luther’s revolt
would not have attracted More’s sympathies. He had never doubted any
of the dogmas of the Church, though he had a plentiful contempt for
many prevailing corruptions which were recognised as such by men to
whom heresy was never imputed by their bitterest enemy. He believed
with conviction a great deal that Erasmus accepted merely _pro forma_.
Luther not only propounded views on specific dogmas which More regarded
as heretical, he challenged the whole authority of Rome; and More
believed in the authority of Rome. But beyond all this the Lutheran
revolt was very soon followed by the German Peasant revolt, which
deluged half Europe with blood. The Peasants’ War was completely
misapprehended in England, where the agricultural troubles, bad as
they were, could bear no comparison with the oppression from which the
German peasants suffered; but its leadership fell, naturally enough,
into the hands of men as fanatical in their zeal for religious as for
social reform. The overthrow of all authority and the universal triumph
of sheer anarchy appeared to be their goal; and the world believed,
or was taught to believe, that it was Luther who had started the
conflagration. The heretical pamphlets which issued from Germany and
Switzerland--lumped together, by those who did not know the facts, as
Lutheran--gave colour to this belief by the virulence of their attacks
on the Papacy and the clergy; and it is small wonder that many of the
most liberal-minded men could anticipate nothing but stark ruin, the
coming of chaos, unless the torrent were stayed. The threatening crash
of all reverence, of all authority save such as could be enforced
by push of pike, seemed to be brought measurably closer, when, in
1527, the Imperial armies sacked Rome in emulation of Alaric, and the
representative of St. Peter was held a prisoner by the representative
of Caesar Augustus.

In the abstract, and under Utopian conditions, More was singularly
alive to the beauty of the principle of practically universal
toleration. But Europe and England were presenting a problem which
could never have arisen in Utopia at all. Even in Utopia, it was
recognised that certain negations were directly anti-social, and that
the propagation of them must be repressed. Here in Europe, it seemed
as if every negation of a received dogma was to be turned into an
anti-social engine. Under the conditions, the toleration of any heresy,
certainly of all such as palpably involved an attack on authority,
tended to anarchy. The conclusion that what was good unreservedly in
Utopia would not be good in England is obvious. We can all see now,
of course, that More misinterpreted the facts. The anarchism was an
accident of the religious movement, which it shed of itself, not an
inherent part of it: the Church lost as much ground by the action of
her own zealots as by the attacks of her most fanatical opponents. But
for a man who interpreted the facts as More did, there was nothing
inconsistent in declaring for toleration in Utopia, but in England
repression.

There is another point, too, which is generally unnoticed. The Utopians
arrived at their religion by reason; they had no way of ascertaining
truth except through reason; hence, for one man to condemn another for
holding a different “doxy” would be in itself irrational. Christendom,
in More’s view, was in a different position. It had received Truth by
direct Revelation, and an Exponent of Truth by Divine appointment.
What the Church had definitely pronounced to be heterodox was to be
regarded finally and conclusively as false. To permit the preaching
of doctrine known to be false was quite different from permitting the
discussion or inculcation of divergent opinions on which there was no
authority qualified to pronounce absolutely. Even at the moment when
More was describing the religion of Utopia, before he had ever heard
the name of Luther, he might with perfect consistency have held that
heresy ought to be repressed in Christian countries. The argument, of
course, has nothing to do with the wisdom or unwisdom of a repressive
policy; it is concerned merely with the “inconsistency” of More’s
Utopian theory and his Catholic practice. Those who found the Divine
Revelation not in the voice of the Church but in the text of Scripture,
were equally convinced that deviation from indisputable Truth should be
punished by the strong hand.

Broadly, the suggestion here put forward is that the Utopian religions
are philosophies: that all philosophies are matter of argument; that
intolerance of opinions which are matter of argument is irrational. On
the other hand (to More), Catholic Christianity is not a philosophy,
but is revealed truth; not therefore matter of argument, except so
far as details have not been defined; that suppression of doctrines
subversive of Catholic truth is certainly legitimate, and may be
necessary.

However that may be, it is undeniable that More appears in the least
favourable light as a Catholic controversialist; losing balance and
tone, he writes _currente calamo_, without restraint, with lapse of
dignity, and with only an occasional redeeming turn of humour. That is
to say, he drops to the normal level of contemporary controversialists
on both sides, instead of abiding in that serene atmosphere which
otherwise distinguishes him. The aggressive bellicosity of princes
grieved him, and the king’s divorce business vexed him: but the spread
of heresy was the one thing which upset his equanimity. “I pray God,”
said he to Roper, “that some of us, as heigh as we seeme to sitt upon
the mountaines, treadinge heretickes under our feete like annts, live
not the day that we gladly would wish to be at leagge and composition
with them, to let them have their Churches quietly to themselves; soe
that they would be content to lett us have ours quietly to our selves.”

Similarly, the one and only ground of reproach against his conduct in
any public matter is that as Chancellor he may have sanctioned putting
heretics to the torture, and did during the last six months of his
office--not before--send certain heretics to the stake. It is true that
the only men in England, in those days, who, having the opportunity,
did not send a single heretic to the fire, were the much-abused
Protector Somerset and the still more abused Wolsey. But we would fain
have had Thomas More an exception. Still, it can at least be affirmed
positively that the penalty was only inflicted when all hope was over
of persuading the “heretics” to recognise their error, and save their
bodies as well as their souls; and that every effort was made to give
them the opportunity of doing so. Given More’s premises, the conclusion
that their death would tend to the salvation of other souls was
irresistible.

It was towards the end of 1529 that Wolsey was struck down, and More,
very much against his will, was elevated to the Chancellorship.
For a commoner and a layman to receive the appointment was almost
revolutionary--at least it was a very signal mark of the depression of
the nobility, although it was many a year since any but an ecclesiastic
had held the office. In everything, More proved himself a notably
admirable occupant of the post, dealing out justice with unprecedented
despatch; not only without allowing himself to be corrupted, in which
he was not unique, but also without accepting those substantial
compliments from suitors which less rigidly scrupulous judges were
in the habit of profiting by, even when they did not allow their
decisions to be affected. No personal or professional considerations
were ever permitted by him to interfere with the ends of justice, the
most exact that it was in his power to achieve. But his tenure of the
Chancellorship was brief. More was unique in many respects, and in his
own day he was unique in refusing to retain office when he could no
longer do so without violating his conscience--without making himself
a party to a policy which he held to be wrong. Other men shifted the
responsibility on to the king; More felt that the responsibility could
not be shifted, and in 1532 he resigned.

The cause of the resignation was Henry’s ecclesiastical policy; its
immediate occasion, the submission of the clergy. The fall of Wolsey
was simultaneous with the summoning of the famous “Seven Years” or
“Reformation” Parliament of Henry VIII. The king had given no sort of
sign of any disposition to relax the severity of his attitude towards
heresy; but as the months and years passed, it became increasingly
evident that his rigid orthodoxy was to be accompanied by a prolonged
anti-clerical and anti-Papal campaign, the meaning whereof was to be
revealed only by degrees. A twelvemonth had barely passed when the
clergy were suddenly notified that they had as a body been guilty of a
breach of _Præmunire_ in accepting the Legatine authority of Wolsey,
and this was followed up by requiring Convocation to affirm that the
king was sole and Supreme Protector and Head of the Church. No new
authority was directly claimed for the Crown--without reading between
the lines; though it was tolerably clear that a good deal more might
be read into the declaration. The clergy yielded. Then the Commons
presented their supplication against the ordinaries. The subsequent
operations showed that the Royal Supremacy was to be applied after
quite a new fashion. The clergy yielded to the logic of force, and made
their “submission.” More, holding that no layman, king or not, could
by any possibility be rightfully head of the Church in this new sense,
concluded that he had no alternative but to retire into private life.


VI

INDIGNATIO PRINCIPIS

The divorce was Henry’s first objective; it was duly pronounced by
the new Archbishop in the following spring. The step, however, was
intensely unpopular. The more clearly this was brought home to the
king’s mind, the more anxious he became to have the avowed support
of every one whose opinion carried weight. Irritation reached its
climax over the affair of the “Nun of Kent,” a young woman named
Elizabeth Barton, who had for some little time been posing as a
sort of prophetess. How far she believed in her own imposture it is
not possible to tell, but she was certainly exploited by fanatical
adherents of the Papacy, and when she took to denouncing the wrath of
God against the king for the divorce, there was a real risk that the
superstition of the day would make her ravings dangerous. There were
two men whom no persuasions had prevailed upon to pronounce in favour
of the Boleyn marriage--Fisher of Rochester and Sir Thomas More. It
was found that both had had some sort of dealings with the nun. Henry
determined that they should both suffer as her accomplices, unless
they would openly range themselves with his supporters. But the case
against More was so hopelessly futile that the king’s advisers warned
him that the ex-Chancellor’s inclusion in the Bill of Attainder could
only result in the Bill itself being thrown out. His name was therefore
removed, to the great rejoicing of his friends. More saw farther into
the king’s mind than they did. “_Quod defertur non aufertur_,” he said
to his daughter.

He was right. The king and Cromwell were ready to go to the last
extremity to force the two recalcitrants into line. An Act had been
passed, fixing the succession to the throne on the children of Anne
Boleyn. The ratification of the marriage had led him to remark to
Roper: “God give grace, son, that these matters be not in a while
confirmed with oaths.” The Act of Succession carried with it authority
to impose an oath to maintain it; but the oath subsequently formulated
was so worded as to bind the subscriber to the admission of the
invalidity of the marriage with Katharine, and the denial of the Papal
authority. The oath was proffered to More and Fisher; both refused it,
though both were ready to maintain the succession. Both were sent to
the Tower.

It was in fact more than doubtful whether the Act warranted the
imposition of the oath in the prescribed form. The imprisonment of the
culprits without trial was in any case illegal, and every attempt to
persuade them to yield failed. The King always preferred to have the
letter of the law on his side; and it was impossible to pretend that
the refusal to subscribe involved treason. To give their destruction a
legal colour, a fresh Act of Succession was passed at the end of the
year (1534), expressly confirming the form of the oath; and this was
accompanied by an Act of Supremacy, making it treason to refuse to
affirm the Royal Supremacy. After that, it was simple enough to send
More and Fisher to their doom. To deny the Supremacy was one thing;
More had abstained from that. To refuse to affirm it was another; More
had always done so. He maintained his position, and was condemned to
death as a traitor, under the law which had been framed expressly
to enmesh him. His defence was only that the law itself was invalid
as being against the law of Christendom, and the liberties of the
Church as affirmed in _Magna Charta_; which of course the judges
could not admit. A week later, on July 6--the Eve of St. Thomas (of
Canterbury)--1535, Sir Thomas More was beheaded.


VII

CHARACTER AND DEATH

Thanks mainly to the charm of the biography by his son-in-law, William
Roper, the private life and character of Thomas More are among the
most familiar to us in history. It is a life good to dwell upon, sweet
and wholesome. Even in its public aspects there is but the single
note that jars, his harshness--_molestia_ he called it--towards the
heretics, whom he classed with homicides and robbers: in its domestic
aspects it is wholly charming. In his private capacity he could love
even a heretic. Roper himself, the sympathetic husband of his favourite
daughter Margaret, was bitten with Lutheran doctrines, which even the
persuasiveness of his revered father-in-law could not induce him to
relinquish. To the error, as he deemed it, which was not accompanied by
propagandism, More was as tender as could be desired. “Meg,” he said to
Mistress Roper, “I have borne long with thy husband; I have reasoned
long time with him, and still given him my fatherly counsel; but I
perceive none of this can call him home again. And therefore, Meg, I
will no longer dispute with him, nor yet will I give him over, but I
will go another way to work, and get me to God and pray for him.”

There we have the natural Thomas More, obeying the kindly dictates of
his own heart, which held no rancour towards any one who had not in
some sort constituted himself an enemy of the “weal publick.” Personal
hostility to himself he held of no account. Shortly before he was made
Lord Chancellor, an old servant of his came to him in great indignation
against some merchants who had been “liberally rayling” at More.
Would he not, seeing what his favour was with the king, punish these
scurrilous people as they deserved? But More’s reply was a very sound
piece of philosophy in his usual humorous vein--“Would you have me
punish them by whome I receave more benefitt than by you all that be my
friends? Lett them a God’s name speake as lewedly as they list of me,
and shoote never soe many arrowes at me, so long as they do not hitt
me, what am I the worse? But if they should once hitt me, then would it
a little trouble me. Howbeit, I trust by Gode’s helpe, there shall none
of them all be able once to touch me. I have more cause, I assure thee,
to pittie them than to be angrie with them.”

We are told much of his simple piety and faith. The same ardently
reverent spirit, which made him cling to the Church and uphold her
authority, at one time very nearly sent him into the cloister, and did
cause him to retain so much of the ascetic tradition that he wore a
hair-shirt next his skin all his days; though it was only by accident
that any one save his beloved “Meg,” Margaret Roper, became aware of
the fact. His subjugation of the flesh was free from its too common
accompaniment of arrogant or morbid austerity. It was little more than
an avoidance of insidious and apparently harmless temptations, an
appreciation of the unimportance of gratifying physical appetites. He
reaped his reward. The sudden descent from ample wealth to a narrow
income, involved in his resignation of the Chancellorship, had no
terrors for him. He had tried hard fare at Oxford, less hard at New
Inn, something better at Lincoln’s Inn. He and his family could very
well live by the Lincoln’s Inn standard. If they found that too high
for the reduced exchequer, there was the New Inn standard to fall back
on, and after that the Oxford standard. And even after that “May we
yeat with bagges and walletts go a-begging togither ... and soe still
keepe companie merrily together.” A cheery philosophy.

Two of Roper’s anecdotes show, in the dramatic touches which bring a
very living Duke of Norfolk before us, how the son-in-law profited
by his father-in-law’s example; besides illustrating More’s quaint
combination of seriousness and humour. The duke went to see him about
his resignation, at Chelsea, and found him singing in the Church choir.
“To whome after service, as they went home togither arme in arme, the
duke said, ‘God body, God body, my Ld. Chancellor, a parish Clarke, a
parish Clarke, you dishonour the King and his office.’ ‘Nay,’ quoth Sir
Thomas Moore smilinge upon the Duke, ‘your Grace may not thinke, that
the Kinge your Master and myne, will with me for serving God his Master
be offended, or thereby count his office dishonoured.’” And again,
when he had escaped the Bill of Attainder: “The Duke sayd unto him,
‘By the masse, Mr. Moore, it is perillous strivinge with Princes, and
therefore I would wish you somewhat to inclyne to the Kinge’s pleasure.
For by Gode’s body Mr. Moore _Indignatio principis mors est_.’ ‘Ys that
all, my Lord?’ quoth he. ‘Is there in good fayth noe more difference
betweene your Grace and me but that I shall dye to day and you
tomorrow?’”

But in the last days, the never-failing humour has an exquisitely
pathetic setting.

The worthy wife, “somewhat worldlie too,” comes to see her husband in
the Tower; she cannot understand why he is so silly as to stop there,
when he might so easily recover the king’s goodwill by doing “as all
the Busshopps and best learned of this realm have done.” He listens
placidly to the outburst, then: “I pray thee, good Mistress Alice, tell
me one thing: is not this house as nighe heaven as mine own?” We are
reminded of the last words Humphrey Gilbert was heard to utter before
the _Squirrel_ foundered: “We are as near God by sea as by land.” But
there was no one to reply to Gilbert as “shee, after her accustomed
fashion, not likeinge such talke, answeared _Tille valle, tille
valle_.” The good soul has no patience for such incomprehensible folly.
Margaret Roper visits him, the darling daughter, of all his children
the likest to him in wit and in person; with her he is sure of perfect
sympathy. She knows that his doom is absolutely certain, nor is she one
to dissuade him from following the dictates of his conscience. After
the sentence in Westminster Hall, she is waiting at the Tower wharf for
the last fond farewell, the parting blessing. Heedless of spectators,
she darts through the press of halberdiers guarding the prisoner, to
fling herself on his neck, pour out her tears and her love on his
breast. He soothes her with words of tender counsel and affection. At
last she tears herself away, but overcome with the passion of devotion,
“suddenlye turned back againe, and rann to him as before, tooke him
about the necke, and divers times togeather most lovingely kissed him,
and at last with a full heavie harte was fayne to separate from him:
the behouldinge whereof was to manye of them that were present thereat
soe lamentable that it made them for very sorrow to mourne and weepe.”

Shall we wonder at such love for the man who on receiving sentence
could say to his judges, as reported by Anthony St. Leger, “I verily
trust and right heartily pray that though your lordships have now in
earth been Judges to my condemnation, we may yet hereafter in heaven
merrily all meet together to our everlasting salvation”; whose spirit
was so imperturbable in its serenity, that it looked upon death as a
mere casual episode which in no wise ruffled his habitual humour. “I
pray you, Mr. Lieutenant,” he said, with his foot on the scaffold,
noticing how ill it had been put together, “see me safe up. For my
coming down, let me shift for myself”: and as he laid his neck on
the block, moving his beard aside, “Pity that should be cut; it hath
committed no treason.”

His head, according to custom, was set on Temple Bar, but Margaret
Roper, she “who clasped in her last trance her murdered father’s head,”
was allowed to obtain possession of it, and preserved it in spices till
her own death. The news of the execution was conveyed to Charles V.
His comment is endorsed by posterity--“If we had been master of such a
servant, we would rather have lost the best city of our dominions than
have lost such a worthy Councillor.”




THOMAS CROMWELL


I

THOMAS CROMWELL

For six years, Thomas Cromwell was palpably and unmistakably the
ruler of England--subject to the approval of the king. For the four
years preceding, it is practically certain that he both suggested
and organised Henry’s policy. England has never known a statesman so
irresistible, so relentless, while his power lasted; nor one whose
downfall was more sudden or so universally applauded. He is the most
terrifying because he is the most passionless figure in our history.
He wrought like fate, with a perfect disregard of all human sentiment
and emotion; a scourge of God. Not, however, a mere scourge like
the earthquake and the pestilence; not a mere destroyer; for, while
he shattered, he built. But for Cromwell, it may be doubted whether
Elizabeth’s England could have come into being.

For a second time Henry VIII. found the man most consummately fitted
to minister to his own ambition; to plan, to organise, to smite--and
to be smitten. As Wolsey, having accomplished his work, fell because
he failed to engineer his master’s matrimonial projects, so Cromwell,
having accomplished his work, fell in attempting to engineer a
matrimonial project which displeased his master. Both the great
ministers were men of humble birth at the best: popular report gave
out that the father of the one was a butcher, that of the other a
blacksmith. The one mounted to power, the last and perhaps the greatest
product of the old relation between Church and State; the other was
the first layman who, lacking even gentle blood, achieved the highest
position in the State, and shattered her old relation with the Church.
The reign of Henry VIII. abounds in huge ironies: it is not perhaps the
least of them that the Hammer of the Monks passed into the service of
the king from the service of the Cardinal.

[Illustration: _THOMAS CROMWELL 1st EARL OF ESSEX_

_By_ HOLBEIN, _from an Engraving by Houbraken in the British Museum_]

Diversities in the judgments passed on Thomas Cromwell are less
marked than in the case of most of the statesmen portrayed in this
volume. There is no possibility of questioning the utter absence
of moral scruple in the methods by which he pursued his ends, the
completeness with which he subordinated every other consideration to
their achievement, the vast organising power he displayed. That he
was actuated by a moral repulsion to the Roman system, or a religious
enthusiasm for the purity of the Gospel, is a view that can only
be put forward on the sweeping assumption that everybody concerned
in the Reformation at all was so actuated, except feeble or wicked
bigots who clung to the old order. Cromwell as a Protestant Martyr is
very much like Frederic the Great as Protestant Hero. Every one who
believes that it was good for England to reject the Papal authority
and to subordinate the Church in England to the State, is bound
to consider that the man who did these things for England rendered
his country a great service. Every one who holds the contrary view as
to the Papacy and the Church must hold that he rendered her almost
immeasurable dis-service. But these are judgments not on the man but on
the circumstances.

Yet there is one very curious fact about Thomas Cromwell. Although he
set his mark indelibly on the history of his country, and in spite
of the exceptionally dramatic course of his career, his name seems
to convey very little to most Englishmen--save as the secretary whom
Wolsey charged to “fling away ambition.” Oliver looms so large that it
is difficult to grasp the idea that another person of the same name
also loomed large a hundred years earlier. No playwright or novelist
has made him a central figure in drama or novel. Yet it may at least be
argued that of the ten characters here examined, his personality was
the one which most decisively influenced the course of history.

EARLIER CAREER AND RISE TO POWER

In the last quarter of the fifteenth century there was dwelling in
Putney one Walter Cromwell, alias Smyth, who appears to have been a
brewer, smith, and armourer, and incidentally to have been a very
troublesome person with a taste for breaking the law in minor matters.
There is no doubt that Walter was the father of Thomas: whose birth
conjecture places about 1485. Down to 1512, the accounts of Cromwell’s
life rest entirely on later gossip, sometimes professedly derived
from remarks which he himself let fall. All reports, however, agree
in saying that he went to Italy when very young--“fleeing from his
father,” one of them avers. It needs no evidence to show that he had
a remarkably enterprising and self-reliant spirit, and if he did
run away from a turbulent parent to seek his fortune by his wits,
it was a course thoroughly consonant with his subsequent career.
The reports state further that he served as a man-at-arms under an
Italian nobleman, and with the French in 1503. Allowing for presumable
inaccuracies of detail, there is no reason to doubt that he tried his
hand as a trader of sorts in the Low Countries and in Italy. There is,
however, definite ground for believing that he returned to England
about 1512, and married the next year. If Mistress Elizabeth Wykeys did
not bring something fairly handsome in the way of a fortune, Thomas
Cromwell must have strangely forgotten himself. For some years, it
may be affirmed with confidence that he took part in business as a
wool-merchant or “shearman,” combining this trade with practice as an
attorney. Documentary evidence puts it effectively beyond doubt that he
was professionally known as a man of law to Wolsey in 1520. In 1523 he
sat in the House of Commons as a Member of that Parliament which, under
Sir Thomas More’s Speakership, declined to discuss the voting of a
subsidy in the Cardinal’s presence.

By this time we are getting away from the region of conjecture,
anecdote, and hearsay, into that of definite records. What we know of
Cromwell’s share in this Parliament is derived from two documents;
one, a letter of his own, in which he gibes at his fellow members for
having babbled at large about everything under the sun without doing
anything. “I have endured,” he says, “a Parliament which continued by
the space of seventeen whole weeks, where we communed of war, peace,
strife, contention, debate, murmur, grudge, riches, poverty, penury,
truth, falsehood, justice, equity, deceit, oppression, magnanimity,
activity, force, temperance, treason, murder, felony, and also how a
commonwealth might be edified and continued within our realm. Howbeit,
in conclusion we have done as our predecessors have been wont to do;
that is to say, as well as we might, and left where we began.’ If
Carlyle had lighted upon that, how his heart would have rejoiced! The
second document, however, suggests that if Cromwell, like Carlyle, had
no great opinion of talkers, he meant his own voice to be heard: since
it is almost certainly the MS. draft of a speech which he prepared for
delivery in that same Parliament. The speech is exceedingly clever, and
most diplomatically expressed--but is dead against Wolsey’s subsidy.
Perhaps he thought better of it, and kept it in MS. If not, it was an
audacious speech to make, for a man who was getting in touch with the
Cardinal, from whose good graces much might be hoped. Still, a like
audacity paid him well some six years later. It may have been carefully
calculated in both instances; but in both there were big risks.@

At any rate, his favour with the great minister increased. He dropped
his wool-business, extended his private legal practice, was entrusted
with much legal work by the Cardinal, and became known as the person
through whom suitors to Wolsey might find it advisable to make their
applications. It was not long before he found, in his capacity as a
man of law, congenial employment in the suppression of small religious
Houses, and the appropriation of their endowments to Wolsey’s colleges
at Ipswich and Oxford. This business he did to the entire satisfaction
of his master; and since he never at any time hesitated to accept or
extract material contributions to his private exchequer from any one
concerned, his accumulations grew _pari passu_ with his favour. So
also, incidentally, did his unpopularity, for which he cared absolutely
nothing. His confidential relations with the apparently all-powerful
minister made him a person of considerable though unofficial
importance; bringing him in contact with people of high position. Thus
in 1527 he was well-known to Reginald Pole (afterwards Cardinal),
whom he counselled to drop high-flown ideas, and learn the practical
business of a politician by studying Machiavelli’s “Prince”--a work of
which he must have obtained a MS. copy, as it had not yet been printed,
though written probably as early as 1513.

But the toils of the divorce business were already enmeshing Cromwell’s
patron; as the year 1529 advanced, clouds, lightning-charged, were
gathering over his head, and the secretary knew that the hour was about
to strike when he himself must either “make or mar.”

We have seen that practically nothing is known with absolute certainty
as to Cromwell’s early years; we have seen also that the reports
about that period of his life are sufficiently consistent with each
other and with his later career to warrant us in assuming that they
were tolerably well grounded. It would be difficult to conceive of
any man thus trained, turning out otherwise than a cynic. At home, we
have the father, a man in a respectable position, who is, however,
eternally being summonsed for some breach of the law. The clever and
independent youngster quarrels with his father, and takes himself off
to foreign parts. He makes for Italy--the land of all others where
brains counted most; the land also where morals counted least; the
land _par excellence_ of poison and poniards; the land where every
one was formally orthodox, and hardly any one--least of all the
priests--believed anything much. Only a religious enthusiast could
pass through the ordeal of life in Italy--at the age of twenty or
thereabouts--without becoming a sceptic. That a Cromwell should have
passed through it without conceiving a most heart-felt contempt for the
whole Roman system would be incredible; but it is hardly more credible
that he should have been converted into a cold, stern moralist. If he
was, he kept the cold, stern morality pretty thoroughly in abeyance
until it found vent in the destruction of the monasteries.

After a brief experience of life in camp and in the guard-room, the
young man is apparently for some ten years knocking about from Venice
to Antwerp, acquiring a sound knowledge of trade and a mastery of the
ways of traders. Then he returns to England and turns his knowledge
to account, combining with it a lucrative practice, as a presumably
somewhat unscrupulous but amazingly clever attorney. Always it is the
seamy side of life which concerns him; and at any rate, after he has
sown his wild oats and acquired experience, he adds to the conviction
that most men would be knaves if they could, the certainty that, at
least in comparison with Thomas Cromwell, most of them are fools. This
consciousness makes him ambitious. He manages to attract the great
Cardinal’s attention by his abilities. The summoning of a Parliament
gives him an opportunity. He prepares a speech for it, which will
certainly make him a man of some mark if it is delivered--and a clever
speech in opposition, as many parliamentarians learned when Parliament
had become a real power, is not always an obstacle to government
favour. Cromwell is still a man of the people, and the speech is on the
people’s side. Whether he made that speech pay him by delivering it or
by suppressing it remains uncertain--either is possible. Anyhow, from
that date his favour and his prosperity advanced rapidly; his thorough
knowledge of law, of business, and of character, and his immense
mastery of detail, making him a quite invaluable servant. And he who
has become invaluable to the first minister of the Court may become
invaluable to the Court itself.

Now what would be the natural political attitude of such a man?
Had there been room for a career as a demagogue when he sat in the
Parliament of 1523, he might have adopted that _rôle_: aiming, of
course, at a dictatorship. But there was no opening. To such a man,
however, it is quite certain that the absolute rule of one man would
present itself as the sole really strong form of government. Absolutism
was taking the place of the old Feudalism all over Europe; Henry VII.
had laid sure foundations for it in England; Wolsey had carried on
the work; it would be the business of Wolsey’s successor to complete
it. The political theory of Machiavelli was not in itself novel; it
must have been familiar, as a latent theory, to every one who knew
anything of the Italy of the Medicis and the Borgias. The novelty
lay in stating it boldly in the open. That, even the author of the
“Prince” had not done as yet: he had merely formulated it for private
circulation. Publication was deferred. But the Machiavellian creed
had reached the hands of Wolsey’s secretary, who had adopted it with
complete appreciation. Its central tenets are the complete divorce
between ethical considerations and political methods, and the complete
concentration of all power under the control of one will. The “Prince”
became Cromwell’s political text-book, whose principles and maxims
he was prepared to apply with appalling thoroughness if ever the
opportunity offered.

It was remarked that before the appointment of Sir Thomas More in 1529,
no one had held the office of Lord Chancellor unless he was either of
noble birth or an ecclesiastic. More, however, was of gentle blood. It
required a yet more violent departure from precedent for the king to
take as his own most confidential adviser a layman of plebeian origin;
and some considerable time elapsed before Cromwell held openly the
position which in effect had already long been his. The story of his
elevation will occupy the section now following: here we have attempted
to present the figure of the man who in the autumn of 1529 was nothing
more than the confidential secretary of a minister who was on the very
verge of the historic “farewell to all his greatness.” The secretary
presents in many respects a very marked contrast to his master, but the
contrast with his master’s successor in the Chancellorship is still
more striking. England never knew a statesman whose politics were so
entirely ethical as More; never one who ignored ethics so completely as
Cromwell. With the one, conscience stood unmistakeably first; with the
other it was non-existent, as far as state-craft was concerned. That is
not to say that the man himself was without conscience or moral sense;
just as Machiavelli, his master, was the last statesman in Italy who
could be called a scoundrel. Cromwell held with Machiavelli that the
political end justifies any means; the only question for the statesman
is, whether in the particular instance a flagrantly immoral method
may frustrate the end sought instead of furthering it, by shocking
sentiments which require to be conciliated. The Italian would not
personally practise all that he preached: his English disciple went
farther. Both doctrine and practice were the direct contradictions of
the doctrine and practice of Thomas More.


III

PLANNING THE CAMPAIGN

The blow fell: the Cardinal was struck suddenly down. What did Cromwell
do? In effect, we have two authorities--Cavendish, Wolsey’s honest
but not over astute biographer, and Foxe, honest too, but ready to
believe whatever chimed in best with his own theories. On Hallowmass
Day, November 1, Cavendish found the secretary in the Great Chamber at
Esher, whither the fallen Cardinal had retired; in much perturbation
of spirit over the prospect of his own ruin for his faithful service
to Wolsey, and resolved, in his own phrase, to go up to London, and
“make or mar.” He did not desert his master, but he went up to London
and made haste to commend himself to the other side. He played his
cards boldly, bidding directly for the favour of Norfolk, with whose
approbation he forthwith entered the newly-called Parliament as member
for Taunton. In fact, he had the wit to recognise that by skilful
management he could be loyal to Wolsey and push his own prospects at
the same time. The move was audacious, and successful. He had three
possible courses. A baser or a less astute man would have tried to win
favour with his master’s enemies by turning and rending his master. A
less daring one would have carefully dropped out of sight, taking his
chance of being able some day to retrieve his position. Cromwell was
bold enough to take up the cudgels openly in defence of the Cardinal,
thereby winning much credit for courage and loyalty: at the same time,
retaining the fallen minister’s confidence. Thus he was also enabled to
manœuvre for Wolsey, and to mollify some of his enemies by judicious
presents, bestowed under his advice and direction--and passing through
his hands. There is no need to discredit either the loyalty or the
courage displayed, but there is no denying that in displaying it he
served his own interests better than he could have done in any other
way.

Cromwell’s public defence of the Cardinal did not in fact mean much
more than active opposition in Parliament to the Bill of Attainder;
and Henry, at any rate, was not thirsting for Wolsey’s blood. It was
probably some time before he quite made up his mind that he could do
better without the man who had done so much for him. It is not unlikely
that what ultimately decided him was the growing perception that he
could make the combination of Cromwell and Cranmer serve his turn
more effectively. He had just caught from the Cambridge Doctor the
idea of discarding the Papal jurisdiction in the divorce in favour of
the National Ecclesiastical Courts supported by the opinion of the
qualified University doctors of Europe. There is very little doubt that
one of the first steps taken by Cromwell was to obtain an interview
with the king, nominally to defend himself against the malice of the
Cardinal’s enemies; and that he turned the interview to account by
hinting pretty openly that he could work out for the king a policy
which would not only ensure the divorce, but bring him much profit in
other ways, making him “the richest king that ever was in England,”
says Chapuys, the emperor’s ambassador.

Now Henry’s was not the type of mind which invents large and
far-reaching schemes of political action; but it was the type which
can appreciate and appropriate a big scheme designed by some one
else. Hitherto, until he became awake to the idea that Clement, under
pressure from the emperor, might actually deny him the divorce, there
is no reason to suppose that he had ever dreamt of quarrelling with the
Papacy as an institution, or with the ecclesiastical body in England.
Recently things had looked as if there might be a serious personal
quarrel with Clement, of a kind for which there were precedents,
and Stephen Gardiner had used distinctly threatening expressions in
that sense to his Holiness. Wolsey’s difficulties had been largely
due to his anxiety lest the divorce should lead to something still
more serious; but that had been all. Now, however, Wolsey was hardly
displaced when the first moves were made in what was revealed later
as a huge campaign, directed in the first instance against clerical
abuses, extending to privileges, and finally absorbing property; in
the course of which every pretension of the Holy See to jurisdiction,
authority or tribute in the realm of England was flatly and decisively
repudiated.

The whole thing worked out in its successive stages with such
systematic precision that there is no room for doubt of its having
been completely planned from a very early stage. Throughout, Henry
identified himself with it thoroughly. But it is almost inconceivable
that he should have had any such plan in his head when he was making
Sir Thomas More his Chancellor, and Norfolk to all appearance his
principal counsellor. On the other hand, the scheme is precisely such
a one as would have formed in the brain of the student of Machiavelli
who felt himself to be the one man who was able and willing to carry
it out in the king’s service. The old Baronage was already hardly
dangerous; a very few judicious blows would make it utterly incapable
of organised resistance; but if the English ecclesiastical body, with
its great corporate wealth, worked in harmonious accord with the
Papacy, under skilful leadership, in opposition to the Crown, the
Crown might not get the best of the conflict. With the Church brought
to heel in England, itself severed from the Papacy, and its wealth in
the grip of the sovereign, the royal will would be irresistible. To
suggest this new policy to the king, with himself as the instrument to
put it in execution, not perhaps all at once, but enough at a time to
carry the king along with him, would be a stroke which could hardly
fail of success; especially as, in enumerating the advantages the
policy offered, the certainty of getting the desired divorce could be
placed in the forefront. Henry could be perfectly relied upon to see
his own advantage in the proposal; he was equally certain to recognise
in the designer of the scheme the qualities needed for carrying it out.
Everything points to Cromwell, not Henry, as the deviser. The only
alternative is, that Henry had already made his plan, but only began to
regard it as practicable after he had guessed at and tested Cromwell’s
capacities as an instrument; a very much less probable hypothesis on
the face of it. Moreover, it is quite certain that neither before 1529
nor after 1540 did Henry show any power of creating out of his own
head a deeply considered and far-reaching policy. When he was left to
himself, or when he went counter to Wolsey or Cromwell, he never showed
himself a statesman who naturally took “long views.”

Cromwell, then, is to be regarded not as the able and unscrupulous
instrument chosen by Henry to carry out his own preconceived design
of revolutionising the relations between the secular sovereign, the
Church in England, and the Papal authority. Henry had the ability to
appreciate and to adopt the plan, but the brain which both conceived
and organised it, as well as the hand which executed it, belonged not
to the king but to the minister.


IV

CONTRA ECCLESIAM

It does not in effect militate against this view, that before Cromwell
could have set any agency in motion, Parliament did itself lead the way
by attacking certain minor and universally recognised abuses, without
waiting for Convocation to deal with them. It needed nothing in the
way of a campaign to ensure reforms being demanded and approved where
the clergy themselves admitted that the existing state of things was
scandalous. The first real blow was struck some months after Cromwell
had obtained the king’s ear, when Convocation, towards the close of
1530, was startled by a message that the whole of the clergy had
offended against the Statute of Præmunire in admitting the Legatine
authority of the deceased Cardinal. That authority had of course been
sanctioned by the approval of the king; but the fact that it was
illegal was not thereby altered. Technically, there was no possibility
of evading the charge. The clergy had broken the law; they must pay the
penalty. They did, fining themselves to the tune of a million or so
of our money. If they had not been perfectly helpless, the impudence
of the demand, coming from the king, would have been simply colossal:
but a demand which cannot be gainsaid can hardly be called impudent.
Wolsey, of course, had been penalised for exercising the authority, but
then there was the superficial excuse that he had obtained his master’s
sanction by beguiling his unsuspecting innocence. Here the king could
not even produce that flimsy excuse.

This financial operation, however, struck the keynote of the
Cromwellian policy. Wolsey had over-ridden the law in procuring the
Legatine appointment: he had sought to do so by demanding Benevolences:
he had sought to do so by overawing Parliament. Now, everything was
to be done under form of law. Even if--unwittingly of course--the
authorities transgressed their legal powers, the transgression was
to be regularised by a statute _ad hoc_. The principle was equally
agreeable to the tender conscience of Henry and the legal proclivities
of his minister.

The huge fine, however, did not satisfy the requirements. Convocation,
in passing the Bill, was compelled to pass also a clause acknowledging
the king as the “Only Supreme Head” of the Church, though it was
allowed to introduce the qualifying phrase “so far as the law of Christ
permits.” Except as an ingenious salve to clerical consciences, the
qualification was futile, since, in the exercise of his supremacy,
Henry would certainly not admit that he was going farther than those
laws permitted, and he would also be the _de facto_ judge on the
question if any one should dare to raise it. The whole clause might be
interpreted as meaning everything, or as meaning nothing--but the king
would be the interpreter.

The Bill, with the clause, was passed in 1531. Again the campaign
rested for about a year. So far, apart from a slight rectification of
abuses, nothing more--in form--had been done than to exact from the
clergy a penalty to which they had rendered themselves technically
liable, and to demand from them the formal admission of what was
asserted to be already the constitutional position of the Crown in
relation to them. In theory there had been nothing in the nature of
innovation. Now, it was time for innovation; so Parliament had to be
called in, as against the Church. But the innovation was to threaten
the Papal claims, so the Church must share the responsibility. Thus a
fresh phase of the campaign opened with the beginning of 1532.

Again there were in the first place obvious abuses which were dealt
with under Acts concerning mortmain and benefit of clergy. These,
of themselves, implied nothing in particular. But it was a very
different thing with the Annates Act: the first direct and manifest
challenge of a Papal claim. Rome had claimed from every bishop on his
appointment to a See the whole of the first year’s revenue. This, as
the Act pointed out, was a very grievous burden on the bishops, for
whose relief this system was to be stopped. Until quite recently, it
has never been disputed that this Bill was introduced in response
to the actual petition of Convocation. That idea was based on the
existence of a document which--closer examination leaves no doubt--did
not proceed from Convocation at all, as had hitherto been supposed.
Chapuys reported at the time that the bishops opposed the measure.
By this time, doubtless, the supremacy business had awakened their
alarm, and others besides Fisher were beginning to dread a rupture
with the Papacy. There are however, two special features which
demand our attention. The Bill was framed ostensibly for the relief
of the clergy, implying that the Crown, not the Papacy, was the true
protector of their interests, and emphasising an antagonism between
English Churchmen and the Pope. Also, it was not required to be put
in immediate execution, but was to be held in suspense during the
king’s pleasure. A double purpose was served thereby, though the
intention was masked. Clement could buy the withdrawal of the measure
by conceding the divorce: while if he should elect to close that door
to reconciliation, it would not be too late to divert the annates into
the king’s pocket, instead of abolishing the impost. The clergy would
be none the better in either event, but the trick would have helped to
keep them on the king’s side till it was too late to change. Henry was
still playing for a divorce with the Papal sanction; he had not come
to regard a final breach with the Papacy as an end desirable _per se_.
Cromwell, we may assume, took a different view, but of course could not
dream of forcing Henry’s hand: what he could do was to have everything
in thorough order for a decisive breach, if and when the moment should
come.

There was something more, however, for Parliament to do, namely its
presentation of the Supplication against the Ordinaries. There is no
doubt at all that in every essential this was Cromwell’s personal
handiwork. It was a double-barrelled attack, from the popular point
of view, on the way in which the Church exercised its jurisdiction;
from the sovereign’s point of view, on the authority of the Church’s
legislation. The whole intention of it was to force the clergy as a
body to admit that their authority, whether as individuals or as a
corporate body, was subordinate to that of the sovereign. Its object
was attained with entire success: it resulted in what was known as the
“Submission of the Clergy,” virtually a complete surrender. The defeat
was practically the death-blow of the aged Archbishop Warham; while the
Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More, found himself so totally opposed to
the principle involved that he resigned office and went into retirement.

Warham’s death at this juncture was most convenient. The old man had
not been sufficiently stout of heart to offer a stubborn resistance to
the new policy, but he had yielded with much misgiving and soreness
of spirit. He had been restive enough to make it doubtful whether in
the last resort he might not decline to pronounce a judgment against
Katharine in defiance of the Pope. By appointing Cranmer to the
Archbishopric, Henry made sure of a primate who would have no qualms
on the point. This security made him ready to precipitate the crisis
which the Pope was craving to postpone or evade. The simple truth was
that Clement felt himself to be completely in the grip of the emperor,
and no conceivable threats from England could have extracted the
desired verdict from him. The fact was unmistakeably revealed by the
publication, in February, of what was in effect an order to Henry to
re-instate Katharine on pain of excommunication. The reply was the Act
in Restraint of Appeals--in form an Act declaratory of the existing
law of England, in effect an announcement of independence--immediately
followed by Cranmer’s judicial pronouncement invalidating the marriage
with Katharine _ab initio_. Until Clement retorted by declaring
Cranmer’s judgment void, Henry abstained from confirming either the Act
in Restraint of Appeals or the Annates Act; their confirmation was his
rejoinder. After that, there might be talk of reconciliation, but the
practical possibility was gone past recall.


V

THE FABRIC OF DESPOTISM

The year 1533 may be regarded as marking the irreparable breach with
the Papacy, though it was not till 1534 that Clement gave his own
formal judgment in favour of Katharine, and Convocation issued its
own declaration that the “Bishop of Rome” derives from Scripture no
more jurisdiction in England than “any other foreign bishop”--two
sentences which may perhaps be regarded as merely bolting an already
locked door. The purpose of Cromwell’s anti-clerical campaign was
so far achieved that the clergy had been driven out of their main
strongholds by their “submission,” and had next been cut off from the
aid of a Papal alliance. These were the preliminary measures to the
assertion in very concrete guise of the untrammelled supremacy of
the Crown in things ecclesiastical and temporal alike, which was the
aim of the policy we have ascribed primarily to Cromwell rather than
his master. An additional reason for so ascribing it is to be found
in the strong presumption afforded by the evidence that Henry himself
did not wish to cast off the Papal allegiance utterly, until he found
that he could get the divorce in no other way. Apart from his fixed
resolution to make Anne Boleyn his wife at all costs, it may be doubted
if he reckoned that the complication of foreign relations involved in
a final repudiation of the Pope’s authority would be compensated by
the more unqualified control of ecclesiastical matters at home. For
him the divorce turned the scale: and since he could not escape the
disadvantages of revolting, he meant to have every scrap of advantage
that could be reaped from it too. The differences which presently arose
between the king and his minister on the conduct of foreign affairs
will be found to have some bearing on this view of the case.

At any rate, the breach being made, Henry was as ready as Cromwell for
aggression; and Cromwell was let loose to carry out his policy--within
the realm--to the uttermost: no longer working in the background, but
in a position as openly dominant as Wolsey himself had occupied.

The first business was to confirm formally the positions already taken
up, in a fresh series of Acts of Parliament, in the early session of
1534; embodying the recent measures, but generally carrying them a step
further. Thus “Peter Pence” were abolished as well as Annates. An
appeal to the King’s Court of Chancery from the Ecclesiastical Courts
was substituted for the Appeal to Rome abolished by the Restraint of
Appeals. The “submission of the clergy” was extended so as to bring the
whole instead of a part only of the canon law under the purview of the
commission to be appointed for its examination. The corollary of the
Boleyn marriage was an Act of Succession in favour of the offspring of
Anne: but the Act carried with it a murderous sting. “I pray that these
things be not confirmed with oaths,” More had said when the marriage
was ratified. His anticipation was justified. An oath of obedience to
the Act was to be administered.

In this affair of the oath, we as usual find Henry and Cromwell in
perfect accord as to policy, but not actuated by precisely the same
motive. The thing in Cromwell’s mind is the Royal Supremacy; he is
determined to be rid of conditions which check the activities of the
Crown, and of men whose influence tends to keep alive doubts as to
the Crown’s legitimate powers. Henry’s point of view is the personal
one. He has done a very unpopular thing in divorcing Katharine and
marrying Anne, and is determined to make every one admit that he was
entirely in the right. Now, there was in England no ecclesiastic so
universally esteemed for probity and saintliness as Fisher, the Bishop
of Rochester; there was no layman who could compare for intellectual
eminence and beauty of character with Thomas More. It was known to the
world that both these men held that Katharine’s marriage had been
valid, and that both disapproved the recent anti-Papal developments. So
also it was known that in the Houses of Religion which stood highest
in reputation for sincerity and austerity, and were untouched by the
breath of scandal, the divorce and the revolt were regarded with
horror. To force these recalcitrants openly to declare in favour of the
divorce and the Royal Supremacy, would be a great triumph. On the other
hand, nothing would so terrorise opposition as the smiting down, before
the horrified eyes of the world, of victims so distinguished. Cromwell
therefore drafted the oath of obedience to the Act of Succession in
such terms that the subscriber would have to swear not only loyalty to
the provisions of the Act, but acceptance of the divorce as right, and
of the Royal Supremacy as theoretically sound. More, Fisher, and some
of the monks to whom the oath was administered, refused to desert their
principles. They would swear to maintain the succession as laid down,
since it lay within the function of the State to order the succession;
but they would not take the oath as it stood. Thereupon they were sent
to prison.

It may readily be believed that the minister, as reported, swore a
great oath when he heard More’s refusal. The moral effect of winning
such converts would have been incalculable: preferable certainly to
shocking public sentiment as the alternative course must do. But he was
not in the least afraid of shocking public sentiment, at any rate if he
at the same time inspired terror; if circumstances demanded victims,
the more conspicuous they were, the better.

For once, however, a point had been overlooked: it appeared impossible
lawfully to proceed to extremities on the ground of refusal to take the
oath. The omission was rectified in the next session of Parliament.
In a fresh Act of Succession, the oath as administered was expressly
ratified, and the occasion was seized to pass a new Treasons Act,
inadequately described as drastic. It was made treason to question the
titles of the queen and the heirs apparent, or to impute heresy or
schism to the king; and the lawyers were able so to interpret it that
mere silence might be construed as treason--it was enough to refuse to
affirm the Supremacy and the rest of it. The two new Acts were brought
to bear on the victims, who remained firm and were executed in the
following summer. There is no shadow of a hint anywhere that Cromwell
suffered a single qualm in working out the destruction of either
More or Fisher, but it is hardly necessary to make him responsible
for the equally ruthless attitude of the king. According to Roper’s
circumstantial narrative, Henry was so vindictive towards More when
once he had turned against him, that he could hardly be persuaded to
have him left out of the Bill of Attainder in the affair of the Nun
of Kent, until the Chancellor, Lord Audley, and others succeeded in
convincing him that Parliament could not possibly pass the Bill with
More’s name included. If ever there was a chance of life for Fisher and
More, it was destroyed when Henry’s fury was roused by the new Pope
making Fisher a Cardinal. These facts illustrate the difference between
Henry’s attitude and Cromwell’s. To Cromwell, More and Fisher are
merely obstructions to his policy. They must either cease to obstruct
or be crushed. To spare them for sentimental reasons would be absurd,
but there is no passion or vindictiveness or animosity about their
destruction, as far as he is concerned.

Never had any king of England wielded so deadly an engine of despotism
as was placed in Henry’s hands by this Treasons Act of Cromwell;
whereof, however, the full force depended on its manipulation by
its designer. The country was in a very short time so sown with the
minister’s spies that the moment any one became obnoxious to authority
it was the simplest thing possible to procure an information of a
hasty word spoken or passed by in silence, of a phrase that might have
carried a double meaning; and the victim’s doom was virtually sealed.
The excuse, of course, was the one on which a tyranny that seeks to
justify itself invariably falls back--that an unparalleled emergency
demands extraordinary powers. It was not, indeed, quite obvious that
there was an unparalleled emergency in existence, but then it might
arise at any moment. Cromwell was going on to a series of measures
which might prove acceptable, but might on the other hand provoke a
storm of indignation. With the Treasons Act ready to his hand, he could
anticipate conspiracy by striking wherever and whenever it pleased him.
It was an integral part of his political theory that Government--_i.e._
the Despot--should have that power. It was not, of course, aimed
specifically at the Church; it was only incidentally concerned with
More and Fisher. The repression of clericalism was only a part of
the scheme for a legalised Despotism. The climax, the theoretical
coping-stone of the edifice, was not achieved till the Act which in
1539 gave Royal Proclamations the force of law; but for practical
purposes, the Treasons Act made Henry a monarch more absolute than any
other in Christendom.

Cromwell, however, had not as yet fulfilled the promise he is said to
have given of making Henry “the richest king that ever was in England.”
As a matter of fact, whatever riches had come in his way Henry would
never have kept a full treasury, since he always emptied it with both
hands. But Cromwell in his capacity as Vicar-General, or representative
of the Supreme Head with unlimited powers--which office was bestowed
on him early in 1535, a few months after the Treasons Act--was to make
him a record present. It was a matter of principle with him, in his
methods, to make rude display to the higher clergy of the fact that
they must now recognise themselves as mere menials of the Crown, whose
functions might be superseded at the royal pleasure; and on those lines
he acted in striking his next blow, sending out a commission of his own
creatures to “visit” the monasteries, and report upon them. It is only
necessary to recall one of his casual memoranda at a later date--“Item,
the Abbot of Reading, to be sent down to be tried _and executed_”--to
feel properly satisfied that the case of the monasteries was prejudged.
The commission was intended to report evil concerning them, and not
good; and the commissioners acted up to their instructions. It is
quite possible that a perfectly impartial tribunal after complete
investigation would have found the evidence hardly less damning; but
what the commissioners did was to pay a series of hasty visits, collect
all the scandal they could get any one to retail to them, insult or
frighten respectable and responsible inmates till they gave confused or
evasive answers, or none at all, to interrogatories, and so to produce
what passed as evidence of a very abominable and corrupt state of
affairs. Whereupon Parliament passed an Act dissolving between three
and four hundred Houses, in effect handing their property over to the
Crown. Some of this wealth was theoretically appropriated to endowing
new bishoprics and to other corresponding purposes; but in practice a
fraction of it only was so utilised. Some of the lands were given away
to people whom it was convenient for the king--or Cromwell--to placate;
most were sold at low prices--with the effect of establishing a new
landed proprietary which in the years long after was to play a part in
the national politics which their creator can hardly have foreseen. It
was not Cromwell’s way to reach for more than he could grasp; before
he made one stride, he had calculated for the next, but he did not
take it till his own time. So he did not wipe out the monastic system
at a blow. The completion of the business waited--like the Royal
Proclamations Act--till 1539. For the present, Cromwell was content to
impose on the greater monasteries, and such of the lesser ones as still
survived, a disciplinary code which professed to have in view the
enforcement of a becoming austerity, but was felt to be so intolerably
severe as effectually to bring about several voluntary dissolutions or
surrenders.

Cromwell’s royal partner, no doubt, in a famous phrase of much later
date, “stood amazed at his own moderation.” But the country hardly
took the same view. The year which saw, in February, the first Act
dissolving the lesser monasteries, saw also in the autumn a rising
in Lincolnshire, very shortly followed by the organised Yorkshire
insurrection known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. As in all the religious
rebellions of the Reformation, the issues were a good deal mixed up
with social discontents; and the last straw was probably a piece of
Cromwell’s handiwork which had nothing to do with ecclesiastical
matters, being a measure known as the Statute of Uses, designed
to get rid of a maze of legal complications which had arisen from
ingenious evasions of the law as to the inheritance of land. The
insurgents, however, put the religious innovations in the forefront
of their schedule of grievances: openly demanding the dismissal of
both Cromwell and Cranmer. The military management of the suppression
of the rebellion was left to the Dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, but no
collision was allowed till the northern levies had been diplomatically
induced to disperse; after which some sporadic outbreaks were used,
after the turn of the year, as an excuse for an extremely heavy-handed
exaction of retribution. Cromwell, however, turned the whole thing to
account; as certain abbots and priors had been more or less deeply
implicated, whereby the opportunity was given for suppressing several
considerable religious communities, and hanging some highly placed
Churchmen. A further result was the re-organisation of the government
of the counties constituting the Marches--those which were always
living with an eye on Scotland, and enjoyed or suffered a special
system of control--by the establishment of a new Council of the North
which diminished the power of the nobility in those regions; Cromwell
always maintaining the same end persistently in view, the weakening of
all power of organised resistance to the king’s will.

Another year brought another opportunity. In 1538, Cromwell discovered
a conspiracy. The South-west of England, like the North, was ever on
what may be called the Romantic side when developments, political or
religious, were in progress. It was now perturbed over the innovations.
It appeared that the Marquis of Exeter, the king’s first cousin and a
grandson of Edward IV., was engaged in some sort of conspiracy with
the Poles, whose mother was the old Countess of Salisbury, daughter
of “false fleeting perjured Clarence.” Amongst them, they stood for
the relics of the old Yorkist anti-Tudor faction. Cromwell had already
taken occasion to warn Reginald Pole--whose diatribes against Henry,
issued from abroad, had brought him under the royal ban--that his
kinsmen in England might pay the penalty for his audacity. Whether
there was any real body in the conspiracy is open to doubt, but there
was quite enough evidence to go upon under the Treasons Act. The
process by attainder practically suppressed any defence. Exeter,
Montague (the head of the Poles) and others were executed; and there
were sufficient means for involving some more Houses of religion, with
their heads, notably the revered Abbot of Glastonbury, who were hanged
as traitors.

Thus, by the opening of 1539, everything was ready for the two final
measures. The regrettable conduct of the monastic establishments in
associating themselves with treason provided a final justification for
the complete suppression of the system, and incidentally the further
enrichment of the Crown. In the field of constitutional practice,
the Crown had frequently proceeded by Royal Proclamations, but there
was generally some attendant danger of the authority of these being
challenged. Parliament was now called upon formally to concede to such
proclamations the effect of regular Statutes. It may be remarked in
passing that the Parliament called in 1529 had been responsible for the
whole of the legislation down to its last session in the early spring
of 1536, when it passed the Act dissolving the lesser monasteries.
Whether it was subservient or not, Cromwell had nothing to do with
packing it: it was only at the last moment that he was provided with
a seat in it. But there is no doubt that the subsequent Parliaments,
beginning with that summoned in May 1536, were packed by Cromwell and
his agents. That was an inevitable part of the system which was to make
the king absolute, whilst preserving the traditional forms.


VI

CROMWELL AND PROTESTANTISM

The policy of organising a Despotism was necessarily anti-Papal and
also anti-clerical. In the former aspect, it complicated foreign
relations; in the latter, it was involved with the movement towards a
spiritual and dogmatic reformation of religion. Cromwell’s course in
foreign politics was dictated by anti-Papal considerations. So long as
Katharine, the aunt of Charles V., was alive, there was no prospect of
reconciliation between the Emperor and Henry, so that England could
not work on Wolsey’s favourite line of holding the balance between
Charles and the French king, who felt himself perfectly safe from any
risk of a renewed combination between his rivals. Hence, Cromwell
usually hankered for close association with the German Protestant
princes, united in the League of Schmalkad, as an effective counter
to the Emperor. Such an alliance might either coerce Charles into a
reconciliation with Protestantism and England, or might make Francis
think it worth his while to join an anti-Papal league. Having this
idea in his mind, Cromwell’s attitude towards Lutheranism abroad and
the religious progressives in England was always friendly: since he
realised that the course of events must divide Christendom under the
Papal and anti-Papal standards, which came to be called Catholic and
Protestant respectively. If Rome were cast off by some of her children,
while others remained faithful, sooner or later the latter would be
compelled to unite for the purpose of crushing the rebels. Thus the
defiance of Rome and of Charles by the pronouncement of the divorce in
1533, was attended by overtures to the League of Protestant Princes.

The Lutherans, however, looked askance. They feared the Greeks _et
dona ferentes_; had not Henry taken the field conspicuously against
their leader? German Lutheranism was deep-rooted in a genuine religious
feeling; it could feel no confidence in the king of England as a
convert to the Augsburg confession. Therefore the princes and the
divines of Protestant Germany went warily. On the other hand, the
isolation of England made Francis more than careless of an English
alliance unless on terms extremely profitable to himself. The death
of Katharine, however, in January 1536, changed the situation. It was
no longer necessary for the emperor to range himself against England.
It is noteworthy that the immediate effect on Cromwell was to make
him desire an Imperial (which meant the old Burgundian) alliance, but
he was promptly pulled up by the king, who had learnt once before
that Wolsey had been right in his policy of holding the balance, and
that he himself had erred in forcing an alliance with Charles. The
emperor and Francis fell to fighting again, and for a while England was
approximately in the old position of having each of the great Powers
intriguing for her alliance, while she held aloof and coquetted with
both. Then the combatants grew tired, and, with the improved prospect
of their reconciliation, their ardour for English friendship cooled.

Just before this time, Henry’s third wife died. Neither his first nor
his second spouse had provided him with a male heir; he had divorced
the one, and cut off the head of the other. Jane Seymour did what was
expected of her, but died in the execution of her duty. One not too
sturdy baby boy, and two daughters who had been judicially pronounced
illegitimate, gave room for uneasiness as to the succession. A
fourth matrimonial venture was thus rendered advisable: providing
opportunities for diplomatic intrigue. The royal ladies of Europe,
however, do not seem to have coveted the position: “If I had two heads,
one should be at the King of England’s disposal,” is said to have been
the caustic comment of a suggested bride. Neither Francis nor Charles
would be inveigled. On the contrary, they patched up a peace in the
summer of 1538, and Henry’s policy of keeping them at odds with each
other, while dangling an English alliance before both, broke down, as
Cromwell’s previous attempt to join decisively with Charles had been
frustrated. Cromwell fell back on the line which in his heart he would
probably have preferred throughout, of alliance with the Lutherans: and
at last he hoped--by finding a Lutheran bride for Henry--to attach his
master decisively to that policy. Henry gave a half-hearted assent; the
minister made his final throw. In the moment of seeming victory, his
knell was sounded. Before we come to this, the last act in Cromwell’s
drama, we may revert to his relations with the religious movement in
England.

In the whole of his record, so far as we have at present reviewed
it, there is not a scintilla of evidence to suggest that Henry’s
Vicar-General ever cared a straw about any properly religious question
at all. We can be tolerably sure, no doubt, as to some of the things
he did _not_ believe in. He did not believe that the Pope was the
holder of the keys to heaven. He did not believe that the clergy
were the divinely appointed channel through whom alone salvation
must be obtained. He did not believe in the effectual sanctity of
relics. Such beliefs would at least have been impossible to reconcile
with his anti-Papal and anti-clerical campaigns. But it would be
exceedingly difficult to find any positive dogma to which it would be
possible to point as an article of faith with him. On the other hand,
every circumstance of his life before 1529, known or surmised, was
calculated to produce and to foster scepticism on the intellectual and
carelessness on the emotional side of religion, generating a hardened
materialism. The resulting attitude towards men who were actuated by
strong religious convictions would be regulated entirely by policy.

Obviously, then, doctrines which weakened the hold of the Papacy,
the priesthood, and the monks, on the popular imagination, would
recommend themselves to his mind--not as particularly credible or
true, but as deserving encouragement, weakening the spell of the
great organisation whose power he desired, for reasons of policy, to
reduce to the uttermost. Hence, it would be his wish to be at least
on friendly terms with the reformers who were defying the Pope and
setting ecclesiastical conventions at naught. More particularly, he
would find the most dangerous opponents of his political design in
that school of English Churchmen, headed by the Bishop of Winchester,
who were determined to employ every instrument of intrigue to retain
as much power as possible for the clergy, and he would seek as natural
allies the men like Cranmer who were unqualified advocates of the
Royal Supremacy. Further, he foresaw the ultimate necessity of a
political understanding, if not the actual alliance which he would
have preferred, with Continental Protestantism. On the other hand, he
was thoroughly aware that the king plumed himself on his theological
learning and orthodoxy; and it was no part of his scheme to run counter
to the king. Hence, it became his business so far as he could to
influence Henry in favour of the respectable reformers--not, of course,
those who were tainted with Anabaptism or the suspicion thereof. But
there is no hint anywhere in his conduct that he thought of the actual
tenets of any reformers as in themselves worth any sacrifice. The king
took a keen interest in theological controversies on their merits; his
minister did not.

This view of his attitude, or of what we should have expected his
attitude to be, tallies precisely with what we know of his actions.
When called upon to intervene in clerical controversies, he habitually
backed up Cranmer as against Gardiner, working in concert with him,
except when he perceived that Cranmer wanted to go farther than Henry
was willing to accompany him. Cranmer was a useful ally, who never lost
his place in the royal favour: and the archbishop’s greatest enemy was
his own also. But when the Six Articles Act was introduced, and he knew
the king’s mind on the subject, he promptly left his ally in the lurch;
though no doubt his influence was exerted, when it had been passed, to
check its active enforcement. The passing of the Act--the crack of the
“whip with six strings”--sufficiently served Henry’s immediate purpose,
which was to make a display of rigid orthodoxy for the benefit of the
emperor and King Francis. Cromwell, who had just committed himself to
the Lutherans too deeply to retract, must have viewed the Act itself
with painful feelings; but he could not afford to resist. Compliance
offered the one chance of bringing his master round.


VII

CROMWELL’S FALL

The Act of the Six Articles, the Royal Proclamations Act, and that
for the final suppression of the monasteries, were all passed in the
early summer--May or June--of 1539, when Cromwell was already fully
involved in his scheme for creating a matrimonial bond between Henry
and the German Protestants. In 1538, when peace between Charles and
Francis seemed imminent, he had succeeded in persuading Henry to
invite a visit from the Lutherans with a view to arriving at a mutual
understanding on the theological questions: but even the reconciliation
of the French king and the emperor failed to make the English king at
all cordial, and the envoys went back to Germany in the autumn with
nothing accomplished. As the year drew to a close, however, there were
ominous signs of a league being formed to threaten England--which
perhaps was one of Cromwell’s incentives to the destruction of Exeter
and the Poles, by way of a hint to the Continental Powers that the
government was far too strong to be endangered by any domestic
discontents. The warnings from abroad had their effect on Henry, who
began to think that a counter-alliance might be really necessary. Thus,
immediately after the New Year, Cromwell opened negotiations with the
intention of obtaining Anne of Cleves, sister of the young duke, as a
bride for King Henry. Yet even this concession to his policy was only,
so to speak, a half-loaf: since Cleves was not actually in the League
of Schmalkald, or irrevocably bound to Lutheranism, though the duke
happened to have his own quarrel with the emperor.

In April, another embassy from the League was in England; but so also
was an ambassador from France, bent on placating Henry--and about the
same time, intelligence arrived that the emperor and the League had
come to terms. So very cold water was poured on the Lutheran envoys,
to whom the Six Articles Act was virtually a direct snub: as it was to
Cromwell, whose policy it signified that Henry meant to desert.

Yet once more the prospect seemed to right itself for the minister.
It appeared that the king had been deluded by the diplomatists, and
that after all the chance of a coalition against England was by no
means dissolved. Before the summer was fairly over, the politest of
overtures were passing between Francis and Charles; while the Duke of
Cleves, who had been to some degree holding off, again became urgent
for the marriage, being, like Henry, threatened with danger from the
restoration of amity between the two great rivals. Henry was beguiled
into believing that the lady of his minister’s choice would make him a
charming and attractive spouse; negotiations were pushed forward apace,
and in the last days of December, Anne of Cleves landed in England. On
January 6 the marriage was celebrated.

But fate was against Cromwell. In the first place, the king took a
violent antipathy to his bride: and though, for an adequate political
end, he would have accepted the situation, his soul was wroth with
the man who had brought him into it. Moreover, so far as concerned
domestic affairs, the minister had done all that Henry needed of
him. He had so handled the Church that she lay defenceless under the
king’s hand. He had brought to the block every one who could be made
a figure-head for insurrection, and had made organised rebellion an
impossibility. He had done all that there was to be done in the way of
despoiling the king’s subjects for the king’s benefit. Finally, he had
just placed in the king’s hand the last administrative instrument of
despotism in the Royal Proclamations Act, as he had before provided
an irresistible weapon in the Treasons Act. He was not required for
any further religious reforms, since his master had already gone as
far as he meant to travel in that direction. There was left only one
reason why the royal anger should be restrained--a demonstration that
his foreign policy was right; that he was needed as foreign minister.
And ere many weeks were passed, conclusive reasons appeared for judging
that the theory to which Henry had endeavoured to cling was right after
all, that a lasting coalition between Francis and Charles was a mere
bugbear, that there had never been any need for the Cleves marriage.
Moreover, the demonstration was effected by one of Cromwell’s two
most determined rivals, the Duke of Norfolk, who at any rate got the
credit for bringing about the open rupture which promptly succeeded
the fraternal embraces of the emperor and the French king. At last the
game was in the hands of Gardiner and Norfolk. On June 10 the bolt
fell. Absolutely without warning, Cromwell was arrested for treason
at the Council, and sent forthwith to the Tower. His own weapons
were turned against him, his own interpretation of treason, his own
favourite process of attainder. Like Wolsey, he had served his master
only too well; and his master rewarded him as pitilessly as he had
rewarded the Cardinal. The only man in England who dared to plead on
his behalf was--Cranmer. On July 28, Cromwell’s head was hacked from
his shoulders. With what measure he meted, it had been measured to him
again.




HENRY VIII


I

APPRECIATIONS

Of both More and Cromwell it has been observed that historians do not
greatly vary in their estimates, when a reasonable allowance is made
for Protestant and anti-Protestant bias. That remark does not hold good
of King Henry. The popular idea of him is more intimately associated
with that of Bluebeard than of any other hero of fiction or history.
Mr. Froude has created a legend of his own, wherein the only doubt
seems to be whether Henry quite passed the dividing line between the
mere hero and the demi-god. Most commonly, he appears as a brutal
tyrant. Among the best informed living authorities in England on the
sixteenth century, one distinguishes him as the most remarkable man
who ever sat on the English throne, and another has characterised him
as a weak-willed bully, always depending for support on some stronger
will than his own; yet neither the one nor the other shows signs of
having been led to his conclusion by any marked bias. The data for his
reign, in the form of documents calendared with exceptional skill,
are peculiarly ample; but the opportunities for drawing divergent
inferences therefrom are extensive. It would be too much to call them
unique, in a century which gave birth also to Elizabeth and to Mary
Queen of Scots.

[Illustration: _HENRY VIII._

_From a Portrait by_ JOST VAN CLEEF _in the Royal Collection at Hampton
Court Palace_]

About the fourth year of Henry’s reign, Thomas Wolsey came to the front
and remained there for sixteen years. For another ten years, Thomas
Cromwell was in the king’s service. During this period of something
exceeding a quarter of a century, did Henry or his ministers control
policy? Great events happened. Did he, in dealing with them, show
himself a great statesman? Or did he merely play the part of a selfish
and greedy libertine? One can only express a personal opinion. The
view which seems most consonant with the facts may be broadly stated
thus. Like his daughter Elizabeth, he had a keen eye for character and
ability; he could appreciate statesmanship in a servant, and he knew
how to get the utmost value out of the men he chose to trust. In the
main, he let them carry out their designs in their own way; but he
remained watchful, and saw to it that if he happened to want anything
not included in their programme, the programme should be altered. He
did not initiate, but he did adopt and make his own, the principles
of Wolsey’s foreign and Cromwell’s domestic policy. A time came when
he wanted from Wolsey something which his minister’s genius was not
adapted to provide; and Wolsey vanished. By slow degrees Cromwell
emerged. A time came when Cromwell had given him all that he could
give, and was seeking to draw his master into paths he did not choose
to tread. Cromwell went to the scaffold. In his remaining years,
the king showed no power of striking out for himself a strong policy
for good or for evil; he had no minister whom he trusted to pilot
the ship; his own pilotage proved crude, and left to the succeeding
government a crop of difficulties with which it was quite incompetent
to cope. His father’s policy had been his own creation; his ministers
had never been much more than clerks. The eighth Henry chose ministers
to create and carry out a policy for him, but always under his own
control. The peculiarity of the Tudor genius, which he shared with his
father and his daughter, lay in the unfailing skill with which they
judged men, and their intuitive appreciation of popular feeling, which
kept them from passing the bounds of acquiescence. Hence, whatever
we may think of their policy itself or of particular acts, whether
our moral judgment condemns or applauds, whether we account their
measures far-sighted or short-sighted, they stand out as great rulers,
accomplishing what they meant to accomplish, and displaying their
activities on a great scale.


II

THE CARDINAL RULES

Henry was his father’s second son. Tradition says that his sire,
ever thoughtful of economy, destined him for the Archbishopric of
Canterbury, and had him educated accordingly. As the boy, however,
became, through his elder brother’s death, heir apparent to the
throne at the age of eleven, the remarkable theological erudition
which he displayed in later years can hardly be attributed to his
early school-room studies--even if the tradition had any more basis
of fact than that it was at least _ben trovato_. Whatever career was
anticipated for him, the utmost pains were bestowed on his education,
and he learnt to take a keen interest in intellectual pursuits. Erasmus
gives an agreeable picture of him at the age of nine, and remarks
on the extraordinary intelligence of his letters a little later--an
intelligence which made the learned man believe that the boy’s tutor
wrote or revised them, till ocular demonstration convinced him of the
contrary. Intellectual pursuits, however, did not absorb the Prince of
Wales. His father was not endowed with any very striking physique, but
the boy rather took after his grandfather Edward IV., being decidedly
handsome, of very athletic frame, and excelling in the sports of
vigorous and healthy youth.

Two months before Henry completed his eighteenth year, his father’s
death placed him on the throne of England--successor to a king whose
later years had been conspicuously sordid and gloomy. Spring with its
pulsing, generous life, followed the sapless dreariness of winter. So
men dreamed, and so probably Henry reckoned, himself. Ugly things like
Empson and Dudley were to vanish into limbo; the king would celebrate
his marriage royally--and follow that up by some splendid martial
achievement. It was still permitted to dream mediæval dreams; might
not the Crescent be once more rolled back before the advancing Cross?
Still, at eighteen there was no great hurry about that, and meanwhile
life might be very much enjoyed. Kings have servants about them to take
the dull drudgery of politics off their hands.

A most excellent state of things, in the eyes of the veterans Ferdinand
and Maximilian. The old king’s martial ardour had resolved itself
into occasional campaigns on which no money was wasted, and in which
no blood was shed, but which somehow had a trick of resulting in the
transfer of hard cash from somebody’s pocket to that of the English
monarch. But surely this open-hearted boy could be persuaded that Henry
V. set a more attractive precedent than Henry VII., and that France
was a good deal nearer than Constantinople. To simplify matters he had
beside him a comely and capable wife, devoted to the Spanish interest,
and all the more likely to influence him, at his age, for being a
few years the elder: and no young prince could have an adviser half
so shrewd as his quite disinterested father-in-law of Aragon. So the
unsophisticated Henry was carefully manœuvred into war with France.
From which he learned two lessons: one that there was frequently a
very marked difference between the words of kings and their deeds; the
other, that military glory or political success cannot be achieved
without close attention to detail. Incidentally, the young king
made another discovery; namely that the comparatively insignificant
ecclesiastic whom old Bishop Fox had introduced into the Council was
as sharp-witted as Ferdinand himself, could do the work of ten ordinary
men, and always knew what he was about.

Before the end of 1514, Ferdinand and Maximilian were made painfully
aware that Henry was not going to be anybody’s tool, by the unexpected
alliance of England and France. The diplomatist who had beaten them
with their own weapons had won the English king’s entire confidence,
and there was only one possible rival to him, in the person of Henry’s
brother-in-arms, Charles Brandon, newly created Duke of Suffolk; nor
was it long before it became patent that the brother-in-arms, having
made himself brother-in-law into the bargain by marrying the princess
Mary, might remain the favourite companion in the hunting field, and
the favourite antagonist in the tournament, but would have very little
to say to the king’s politics. Wolsey had not only thoroughly impressed
his master by his immense administrative ability, his capacity for hard
work, and his astuteness; he had also succeeded in giving a new turn
to the king’s ambitions, making them political rather than martial.
The campaigns of 1513 had restored the prestige of English soldiers
at least in a respectable degree; the outwitting of the craftiest
prince in Europe next year showed that there was a worthy successor to
Henry VII.; that monarch was reputed to have left in the royal coffers
wealth so enormous as to be almost inexhaustible; Scotland had suffered
such a blow at Flodden that she could not, for the time at least,
hamper English action. Henry therefore could now hold the balance
between the potentates of Europe, and become the controlling factor in
international affairs. Such a position was much better worth working
for than reconquests of French soil, or even the recovery of the French
crown, which Henry V. had won but had not lived long enough to wear. As
for crusades, Henry was old enough now to know that in the eyes of a
practical politician they were out of date.

Schemes for dominating Europe were much affected by the fact that in
1514 many important changes in the personality of the rulers were
obviously impending. Henry, twenty-three years old, was the only young
man among them. But on the next New Year’s Day, France was to pass
from Louis XII. to young Francis of Angoulême, aged twenty. In 1516,
Ferdinand was to be succeeded by his grandson Charles, aged sixteen. In
1519, Maximilian was to disappear; and, inasmuch as the Empire was not
technically hereditary, much would depend on the Imperial election, in
which, however, the chances were that Ferdinand’s heir would prove to
be Maximilian’s heir also.

From 1514, the figure of Wolsey--very shortly to become a
Cardinal--completely dominated English politics. The king resigned
himself wholly to his guidance, and for many years there was no more
talk of Henry leading victorious armies over the Continent. The rival
ambitions of Francis, Maximilian, and others, chiefly concerned with
the annexation of Italian States by one potentate or another, the
playing off of rivals, the paying and withholding of subsidies, were
the main business in hand till the demise of the emperor, early in
1519, opened the great question, who was to wear the Imperial crown?

Young Charles was already king of all Spain, and lord of the Burgundian
heritage. He was also heir to the Austrian and other German possessions
of Maximilian, who, like Ferdinand, had been his grandfather. For some
time, Habsburg had followed Habsburg as emperor. There was no other of
the princes of Germany strong enough territorially to bear the weight
of empire, and Frederic of Saxony, _capax imperii_, had no mind for the
undertaking. If Charles were elected he would wield enormous powers.
The French king, ambitious, and dreading the further aggrandisement
of a rival whose dominions were already so great, came forward as a
candidate: his success would mean an accession of power to France even
more dangerous to the European balance than that of Charles. Under
these circumstances, it is not incredible that Henry really meant
business in taking steps with a view to obtaining the Imperial crown
for himself. At twenty-eight, he was quite young enough to believe
that the thing was really practicable: and if practicable, it would
be a magnificent fulfilment of his ambitions along the very lines on
which Wolsey had directed them. It is not, however, credible that the
Cardinal should have taken that view; whether the king was or was not
merely playing with the idea, his minister must have known that it was
chimerical. The agent, Richard Pace, very soon made it quite clear
that it would be sheer waste of energy and money for Henry to enter
seriously for the stakes, and Cuthbert Tunstal was careful to point
out that in burdening himself with the responsibilities of the Empire,
he would be losing for the sake of a shadow the solid substance of his
power as King of England. Henry’s candidature was withdrawn, and no one
was any the worse.

The episode, however, suggests certain conclusions. It is almost
impossible to doubt that the idea of the candidature was Henry’s own;
it is difficult to doubt that he did contemplate it seriously. It was
consistent--in intention--with the conception of political predominance
as a more substantial object of ambition than military laurels. It
was of a grandiosity which appealed to the imagination, but not to
the practical judgment of a far-sighted statesman. That Henry should
have taken it up is entirely consistent with his character as we have
conceived it. On the other hand, if he had been merely a monarch who
allowed himself to be habitually managed, but broke out in occasional
fits of obstinacy--as weak men do--he would have struggled to the last
for that election. In fact, he did interfere with Wolsey the moment he
thought he could better the minister’s plans, but when he saw he had
made a mistake, but could retire without loss of dignity, he did so
without losing his temper. Later in life he might have made himself
unpleasant to somebody, under like conditions. That would have depended
very much on how far he had set his heart on the particular object he
found himself called upon to surrender. In the present case, Wolsey
had ostensibly done everything possible to make the scheme succeed.
He may never have attempted dissuasion, relying on the inherent
impracticability of the whole thing to prevent any really awkward
consequences. At any rate, Henry’s confidence was in no way diminished.

There was indeed little enough reason to be dissatisfied. Western
Europe was in the hands of three young men, of whom the eldest, Henry,
was twenty-eight, and the youngest, Charles, was not twenty. If Charles
had the widest dominion, his task was also the most complicated. He
could only pass to his Teutonic from his Spanish territories by sea;
French territory was continuous. If Charles and Francis quarrelled,
each would want the friendship of England: for her enmity to Charles
would mean immense injury to the trade of Flanders, and her enmity to
France would mean serious military embarrassments in the direction
of Picardy. So for some time to come both were eagerly seeking an
English alliance, while Wolsey’s skill was sufficiently tasked, but
not _over_-tasked, to keep the pair of them in play; and to keep them
at peace, since if they once went to war it might prove exceedingly
difficult to avoid embroiling England.

In 1520 the competition between emperor and king for English
favour--which both took to mean the Cardinal’s favour--was particularly
lively, with the result that the great meeting at the Field of the
Cloth of Gold took place, designed to signalise the enthusiastic
amity of Henry and Francis. Wolsey, however, had manœuvred a less
magnificent meeting in England, only just before, between Henry and
the emperor; and no one could say that either of the rivals had really
won a lead over the other. But it became increasingly difficult to
prevent a collision between them, and a year later, when Wolsey was
ostensibly making a great effort at the Conference of Calais to effect
a reconciliation, he was in reality coming privately to terms with
Charles. If England was to be dragged into a war, she would be on the
Imperial side.


III

WAR

Why did England go to war with France, instead of resolutely holding
aloof? The Cardinal cannot have seriously thought of the war as a means
to the recovery of the French crown: nor can he have held it good for
England that France should be crippled, and the Emperor magnified. If
he went into the war of his own free will, if he urged it on Henry,
it can only have been with the purely personal object of so binding
Charles to him as to ensure his own election to the Papacy at the
next vacancy. Yet at the time of the Calais Conference there was no
immediate likelihood of the reigning Pope’s death; Wolsey was surely
the last man to count on the gratitude of princes for past favours
as an effective motive, and Charles had already shown a thorough
appreciation of the doctrine that promises are made to be evaded.
Moreover, so shrewd a man as the Cardinal would presumably have
felt extremely doubtful whether the Papacy--with Charles master of
Europe--would be much worth having. The only remaining suggestion is,
that Wolsey foresaw great domestic troubles, and took the time-honoured
course of trying to divert attention by plunging the country in war.
The obvious objection to that is that there were no pressing signs of
disturbance at all.

The mere fact that the war was a regular reversal of the methods
Wolsey had hitherto followed, points to its having been undertaken
against his judgment. But is it unreasonable to suppose that it was not
against the king’s judgment? That Henry for the second time indicated
the course which his minister was to follow, and the minister obeyed
rather than resign? In those days, ministers did not resign, unless
they were exceptional people with consciences, like Thomas More: and
for Wolsey--whose political existence, if not his life, depended
entirely on the king’s favour--to resign would have meant virtual
suicide. On the other hand, there were influences which would affect
Henry in favour of the war, intelligibly enough. To him, the conquest
of France with the help of Charles may not have seemed absurd, and he
was not ashamed to avow it as his object to Parliament, when asking
for money. Apart from that, there was always a military party headed
by men who felt themselves much more likely to achieve honour and fame
on the battlefield than in the Cardinal’s ante-room: and if there was
to be war at all, there was a sort of standing sentiment in favour
of fighting the French. Lastly, the king was still on good terms with
his wife, and his wife was a most determined advocate of her nephew’s
interests. Henry was even now only just thirty, and the glamour of
military achievement might still tempt him. It certainly seems the most
reasonable conclusion that it was not Wolsey who dragged the king into
war, but the king who forced war on Wolsey.

As a matter of fact, events proved that there was very little to be
made out of the war. After eight years, Wolsey found himself compelled
to call a Parliament again, in order to get money--whereas it had been
his consistent policy to dispense with Parliament altogether. The war
was at any rate not sufficiently unpopular to prevent the voting of a
substantial subsidy; but as time passed, such favour as it had found
with the public faded; the Cardinal did not venture, when more money
was needed, to ask Parliament for it again, and when he tried to raise
what was called an Amicable loan, the response was cold. The disaster
of Francis at Pavia, though it suggested more talk about recovering
the Crown of France, offered no opportunity for material advantage
to Henry, and it very soon became evident that Charles was so much
the master of Europe that his career would only be held in check by
an Anglo-French alliance, which it became the Cardinal’s business to
contract in 1527.


IV

THE “DIVORCE”

This was precisely the time at which there is no doubt that the
question of divorcing Katharine of Aragon was very much on the minds
both of king and Cardinal. In discussing that subject in the preceding
study of Wolsey, nothing was said of the theory most adverse to
Wolsey--that the idea originated with him, and that he suggested it
with the specific intention of breaking the alliance with Charles and
substituting a French marriage, a French alliance being now his object.
On this theory it is argued that the king’s intention of using the
divorce to marry Anne Boleyn was sprung on the Cardinal as something
quite new, on his return from the French embassy; his absence having
been turned to account by his enemies, with the simple object of
wrecking his policy and ruining him. The fact that Henry afterwards
publicly acquitted Wolsey of having instigated the divorce may not
count for much as evidence of his innocence; but there is another grave
objection to the theory. If Henry told him that the divorce must be
managed somehow, he would doubtless have considered that the least
injurious result would be a French marriage; but it is not easy to
imagine that he would himself have sought to bring about a step which
would have made so permanent a breach between Henry and Charles. His
own policy was to keep it always in the power of England to shift
from one side to the other--to trim the balance between Charles and
Francis. The theory is put forward to square with a particular view
of Henry’s character--that he was managed by any one who could get at
him. But it makes the Cardinal himself somewhat unintelligible--or
unintelligent.

The view advanced in these pages is, that for the third time the king
laid down a policy of his own for the Cardinal to carry out. In the
first place he had two personal reasons for wanting the divorce--a
superstitious impression that the failure of Katharine to supply him
with a male heir was Heaven’s punishment for a marriage which the Pope
ought never to have sanctioned; and a passion for Anne Boleyn. In the
second place, the policy of alliance with Charles against Francis
had worked out badly, and a rupture with Charles must come in any
case. Wolsey should manage it, or should help: and if he began with
a belief that a French marriage might be the outcome, there would be
no harm done. The policy, as before, was a deviation from Wolsey’s,
but did not seem superficially to run counter to the broad principle
on which it was based, that England was to prove her effective
predominance by throwing her weight into the French or the Imperial
scale as circumstances might demand. But, as before, the method
was short-sighted. On the other hand, we find Wolsey behaving also
precisely as he did before. If the king did elect to lay down a policy,
he must be the instrument through which it should be carried out.
He could not prevent it; he must make the best of it, and as far as
possible neutralise the bad effects by skilful handling. He made his
attempt, failed, and fell. It would have been better for his credit if
he had fallen in open instead of in covert opposition.

It remains in any case impossible to dogmatise; the whole thing is
a tangle, and there are difficulties in the way of accepting each
solution. To the theory that the divorce was primarily a plan of
Wolsey’s in order to facilitate a French alliance, there is a further
objection that a negotiation was already on foot for marrying the
Princess Mary to Henry of Orleans, the French king’s second son, who
afterwards became Henry II. The substitution of the marriage of the
king himself to a French princess would have hardly been in itself
a closer bond; yet we should be compelled to believe that Wolsey
deliberately, with no greater advantage in view, sought to make this
change at the cost of a probably irreparable breach with the emperor.
The political motive is inadequate. Whereas, for the king, who had a
powerful non-political motive thrown in, the plan becomes intelligible
enough. The divorce should be so managed that Mary’s legitimacy should
still be secured, the marriage with Orleans could go forward, and he
himself would get the wife he wanted. That in 1527 his passion for Anne
was a very powerful motive is not to be disputed--the love-letters,
uncertain as their dates are, cannot be attributed to a still later
time.

It is also tolerably clear that the king meant to have the divorce in
any case, whether it upset foreign relations or not. Moreover, if the
plan was Wolsey’s, he would have been satisfied to leave the Cardinal
to work it out, which he was not. From the beginning he appears to have
suspected--if there was not more than a suspicion--that his minister
disliked the whole idea, and would be only too pleased if it were
shelved; and he employed other agents to get the thing done, behind
Wolsey’s back. Wolsey was very much in the position of a lawyer whose
client, with whom he cannot afford to quarrel, insists on his adopting
a certain course in defiance of his own judgment. He devised ingenious
expedients; he tried to make his case as safe as possible; he gave
nothing away to the other side; but he was reluctant throughout, while
the king was invincibly obstinate.

Assuming then that it was Henry, not Wolsey, who from the commencement
sought the divorce, the Cardinal’s consistency is restored. So far
also the consistency of Henry’s character is maintained. He never laid
out a great political scheme, calculating for the future; but when
Wolsey formulated a large design, he readily recognised its merits,
and recognised Wolsey himself as the man to carry it through. But
three times he was moved with a desire to obtain a particular end,
without realising that to do so would overturn the main scheme; on
each occasion the minister formally and officially obeyed his master’s
behest. Over the divorce, however, Henry’s behaviour presents an
interesting psychological study.

There have been many statesmen, successful in varying degree, who have
quite deliberately ignored moral considerations in their policy. They
have not admitted that unrighteous action as such carries any penalty
attached to it. Crime which shocks public sentiment violently they may
avoid; not because it is criminal, but because public sentiment cannot
be ignored. The mere fact that a particular course of action involves
injustice or cruelty, or otherwise over-rides the moral law, is not
permitted to weigh at all in judging of its expediency. Such a one was
Thomas Cromwell. There have been others who would never allow any claim
of mere expediency to countervail against the dictates of conscience.
Such a one was Thomas More.

The average man is content to compromise: not drawing the line very
high, but still drawing it somewhere. Henry belonged to the class
who would never violate conscience; but, when any particular course
presented itself to his mind as expedient or desirable, he had a quite
unique power of convincing himself not only that the thing would not be
wrong, but that conscience positively clamoured that it must be done:
nothing was so monstrous that he could not solemnly persuade himself
that it was a sad duty. There are men who are made that way. They will
rob the widow and swindle the orphan, but they must and do first trick
themselves into an amazing belief that in so doing they are serving
heaven or society. Henry was much more dangerous than a commonplace
hypocrite who assumes a mask to deceive the world, since he had to
begin by making the deception convincing to himself.

Thus it was in the matter of the divorce. It was of real urgent
importance that he should have a male heir, and there was no hope of
his wife giving him one; he wanted very much to marry Anne, and he
could not do so while his wife was living; but with what conscience
could he get rid of that wife? Henry’s conscience gave him the answer
he wanted, pat: it always did. Conscience pointed out that the children
of the marriage, except one girl, all came to grief--were still-born,
or died in a few weeks. Surely, here was Heaven’s judgment on a
sinful union. True, the contracting parties had sinned with a Pope’s
benediction, and thinking there was nothing wrong. But clearly the
Pope must have erred. Conscience therefore did not merely excuse, it
demanded, the dissolution of the unholy bond. Conscience permitted
Henry to declare fervently that nothing would please him so much as
to find that his scruples were groundless; but nothing would ever
have persuaded him that they were so except perhaps the death of Anne
Boleyn. Having once thoroughly satisfied himself that the divorce was a
duty, whatever any one might say to the contrary, it followed that some
legal method of accomplishing it must exist. If the Pope did not see
the thing in the same light, there must be something defective in the
Papal authority after all. The scruple of conscience gradually assumed
an axiomatic character to Henry; and the repudiation of Clement, who
regarded it as an extremely questionable postulate, followed logically.

Until Clement revoked the cause to Rome--a practical demonstration that
he would not sanction a verdict objectionable to the emperor--nothing
demanding revolutionary measures had occurred. That event, however,
changed the situation. There would have to be a fight with the Papacy,
which could not be conducted under the Cardinal’s captaincy. The
Cardinal had failed badly; his behaviour had been suspicious. It did
not take the conscientious monarch long to discover that advantage had
been taken of his own generous trustfulness, that he had been warming
a viper in his bosom. Wolsey was thrown to the wolves. It is curiously
characteristic of Henry that the instrument by which he shattered
Wolsey was the charge of a breach of _Præmunire_ in accepting and
exercising the legatine authority. The mere fact that this had been
done with the king’s own licence, almost at his instigation, would have
checked any other monarch. Henry found in it an additional cause of
offence. The Cardinal had not only broken the law--he, whose business
it was to see that the king did not accidentally transgress, had
actually inveigled the king into transgression. A just man, tricked
by his own familiar friend into committing an act of injustice, feels
righteous indignation against the friend. Such was the indignation of
the king against the Cardinal, as of Adam against Eve.


V

THE NEW POLICY

The fall of Wolsey marks, as the beginning of the divorce proceedings
really commences, the second stage of Henry’s career. Had he died
before 1529, the Bluebeard legend would never have been applied to
him, and his connexion with the Reformation would have been in effect
limited to a controversial pamphlet in favour of the extreme Papal
claims, directed against Luther. This was all that the uprising of the
great Reformer had evoked from the prince who was expected to be the
royal champion of the Intellectuals. No one would have called him a
tyrant. It is true that Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, had been
put to death at the beginning of the reign--as tradition says, in
fulfilment of the advice of Henry VII. It is true also that Buckingham
had been executed, not so much because he had committed any treason as
because he was thought dangerous; but the world would have been content
to leave that as one of the charges against Wolsey. Henry would have
passed with posterity as a pleasure-loving monarch with a great taste
for extravagance, who cheerfully left the government of the country
to an able and unscrupulous minister, and did absolutely nothing
personally in the twenty years of his reign to justify the high hopes
with which his accession was hailed. The reign would have been recorded
as the reign of the Cardinal, and our ideas of the king himself would
have been conveyed mainly in the anecdotes of his personal vanity
and love of pageantry and popularity. It is the forcefulness, energy,
and resolution--or the violence, fickleness, and obstinacy--displayed
in the second period which make us revise our judgment of the
first, and set us seeking therein for some appearance of these same
characteristics, and discovering in them the explanation of some
puzzles in the Cardinal’s policy.

The new stage of Henry’s career presents us with a problem at the
outset. Hitherto, he had followed Wolsey’s counsels; very shortly,
the Machiavellian maxims of Cromwell guided his course; but there is
no one to bridge the gap between Wolsey and Cromwell. Sir Thomas More
succeeded the Cardinal as Chancellor, but not as first minister--he
never made any secret, to the king, of his conviction that the marriage
with Katharine could not and should not be invalidated. Nothing
points to Norfolk or Suffolk as guiding policy. The newly discovered
Cranmer had suggested a principle for dealing with the divorce, but
his appearance is merely in the character of a University doctor, not
of a statesman. Precisely at this moment, before he knew anything of
Cromwell, with Wolsey, so to speak, hanging on the very verge of the
precipice, a Parliament is called suddenly, which remains undissolved
until its seventh year. Since 1515 there had been only one Parliament,
that of 1523-1524. Between 1500 and 1515 Parliaments had been rare.
Henry VII., when he no longer felt the need of constant Parliamentary
sanction, and Wolsey after him, had gone steadily on the rule of
accustoming the country to have the government carried on almost
without Parliaments, and of establishing absolutism on those lines.
From this moment that attitude towards Parliament disappears. For
the rest of the reign, there is no prolonged interval without one;
Parliament itself is converted into the instrument and the buttress of
despotism.

In the preceding study of Thomas Cromwell the view was adopted that
he was the real author of what was one comprehensive design for
establishing the royal power high over everything else, including
therein the repudiation of Papal rivalry, and the subordination of the
clerical organisation; while the method, of deliberately choosing to
make Parliament share the responsibility, was his also. Yet the calling
of this Parliament in 1529, and its initial measures of ecclesiastical
reform, cannot be attributed to him. Henry did it out of his own head.
It will be found, however, that the apparent contradictions are easily
reconcilable.

Henry found, in 1529, that his determination to have a divorce would
involve either a fight with the Papacy or a struggle to secure Papal
support in despite of the emperor. Also he felt that the Cardinal was
not to be depended on as the manager of that struggle. He had no one
ready to take the Cardinal’s place, though Stephen Gardiner might have
done so had he been a layman. He had formulated no plan of campaign
beyond that of sending the Earl of Wiltshire, Anne Boleyn’s father,
with Cranmer in his train, on an embassy to Bologna. But he might
find himself impelled to do more or less questionable things; the
precedent of his father’s first years suggested that in that case it
would be useful to be able to say that he had acted with the sanction
of Parliament; and he had the Tudor instinct of appreciating the value
of conciliating popular sentiment. Nothing would conciliate popular
sentiment so much as inducing his subjects to believe that it was
their interests and their opinions he was consulting. So he summoned
Parliament.

Thus, Henry called the Parliament: Henry authorised clerical reform:
Henry meditated a possible quarrel with the Pope. But it was Cromwell
who co-ordinated Henry’s ideas--clever enough as far as they went, but
not going far--into a single far-reaching scheme, wherein the things
his master had thought of were nicely adjusted, gaps were filled
in, consequences calculated, and a systematic evolution arranged in
which every step should seem the corollary of what had already been
accomplished. How far individual steps were invented by Henry, and how
far by Cromwell, it is not possible to gauge. Cromwell never assumed
the pose of Wolsey--the pose which the Cardinal did indubitably adopt,
although it was erroneously inferred from the famous if legendary
phrase, _Ego et rex meus_. He was always ostensibly the king’s
instrument. In Wolsey’s time a question had once arisen whether in
sending certain official despatches the full information should be
sent to him, and only general remarks to the king, or _vice versa_.
That would not have happened with Thomas Cromwell. The full official
despatch would have gone to the king as a matter of course--but
Cromwell might have had a private unofficial commentary. Henry,
during the Cromwell _régime_, was in constant evidence as the ruler
of the country. During Wolsey’s _régime_, he ostentatiously left the
management in Wolsey’s hands. But during both periods we can at any
rate form a shrewd guess at the points on which king and minister were
in harmony, and those where the minister had to yield to the king.

Beyond minor reforms of abuses, and the movement for taking the opinion
of the Universities on the divorce, there was no immediate sign, after
the Cardinal’s fall, of a definitely anti-clerical or anti-Papal
policy. The first blow--the demand for a ransom from the clergy under
the _Præmunire_--would have been entirely characteristic of either
the king or Cromwell: the idea was after all merely a very much more
audacious application of the method adopted towards Wolsey. Whoever hit
upon the notion, it was made the first step in the systematic grinding
down of the clergy between the upper and the nether millstones of
financial spoliation and political subjection. The Supplication against
the Ordinaries in Parliament, the Submission of the Clergy, forced upon
Convocation as the clause of the “Supreme Head” had been, appear to
be more decisively Cromwell’s handiwork. There is no adequate reason
to suppose that Parliament had these measures thrust down its throat:
anti-clericalism was not a new idea, and was usually popular; and if
the Supplication included matters about which the general public cared
very little, such as the right of ecclesiastical legislation exercised
by Convocation, it also carefully embodied popular grievances, though
they may not have been as flagrant as was represented. But on the
other hand, if the Supplication emanated from any one but Cromwell, it
implies an elaboration of organised action among private members which
there is nothing to corroborate. It must have been what may be called
a Government measure, which on the whole had the support--possibly the
enthusiastic support--of the House. The Annates Act, opposed by the
bishops, was not enthusiastically adopted by the Commons--not so much
because they objected to depriving the Pope of the impost as because
they saw no reason why the clergy should be relieved of it. They did
not realise that the king and Cromwell had no intention of allowing it
to become an effective measure of relief at all.


VI

DIVERGENCES BETWEEN HENRY AND CROMWELL

In short, down to the pronouncement of the divorce, Henry and Cromwell
are clearly working in perfect accord--whether minister or king
devised the programme: Convocation is being steadily compelled, very
much against its will, to endorse the propositions of the Crown,
and Parliament is at any rate acquiescent. We may, however, suspect
that Henry, up to this point at least if not for nearly a year
more, inclined to hope that the Pope might yet give way; whereas in
the overtures to the Lutheran Princes in 1533 we may see Cromwell
working to make doubly sure the assurance of complete severance from
Rome. The Lutheran alliance was unquestionably a favourite scheme of
Cromwell’s, but the king never did more than dally with it. In his pet
character of theologian he could never bring himself to accept the
Augsburg Confession, or any compromise which would have satisfied the
Protestants.

Cromwell was always possessed with the belief that a combination of
Powers favourable to the Papacy would be formed sooner or later for
the destruction of England and the Protestants on the Continent: the
coalition of Charles and Francis was his bugbear. On the other hand, he
saw no hope of an effective union between England and France; while he
fancied that, if the bar between Henry and Charles, irremovable while
Katharine lived, were once annulled by her death, the emperor--whose
troops had sacked Rome in 1527, and who had in many respects evinced
very little real regard for the Pope’s authority--might be brought
over to the anti-Papal side. Therefore, whenever he thought there was
a prospect of effecting an Imperial alliance, he let the idea of the
Protestant alliance go; whenever the Imperial alliance seemed hopeless,
the Protestant alliance re-appeared on his programme.

Henry, however, was not at one with Cromwell. He looked askance at the
idea of a Protestant alliance because he did not consider himself a
Protestant; on the contrary, he accounted Lutheranism as heresy, and
himself as a pattern of orthodoxy. From his point of view, the only
quarrel with Rome lay in the Pope’s assertion of usurped claims to
jurisdiction, which either Charles or Francis might find themselves
ready to repudiate in their own dominion at any convenient moment.
He remembered Wolsey’s doctrine. Francis and Charles had so many
antagonistic interests that they could never co-operate for long. The
business of England was to make each desire her alliance; to avoid
the mistake of committing herself too deeply to either. For a short
time--in 1539--he began to think that Cromwell might be right about the
danger of a coalition, and accepted the plan of the Cleves marriage as
a defensive measure. The marriage was hardly accomplished when a fresh
breach between the rival princes showed that his own view of the danger
had been right. There never was, either in his own time or later, a
Catholic coalition against England. At the same time it is at least a
tenable view that a Protestant union, steadily maintained, might have
had great results; on which it is not uninteresting to speculate, but
the speculation is too much guesswork to be profitable.

Henry’s views, then, on foreign policy, differed from his minister’s,
and it was Henry’s views that prevailed, except in the episode of the
Cleves marriage; and in that particular case, there was so startling an
appearance of a real _rapprochement_ between Francis and Charles that
the king’s deviation along Cromwell’s lines can hardly be attributed
to weakness. And even so he took careful precautions, as long as the
thing was possible, to preserve a loop-hole for his own withdrawal,
however deeply his minister might be committed.

In the ecclesiastical policy also, as it emerges after the definite
breach with Rome, Cromwell was evidently more inclined to encourage
the advanced school than his master. Henry made Cranmer Archbishop,
wanting in that post a man who accepted whole-heartedly the theory
of Royal Supremacy. As long as the reforms proposed were restricted
to dealing with notorious abuses of the kind which Colet had freely
denounced, and to the introduction of an English Bible--which the
Conservatives might regard as dangerous, but could not denounce as
in itself heretical--Henry was prepared to give his sanction; but
whenever doctrines were in question as to which the followers of the
“Old Learning” were in solid agreement, Henry consistently held with
them. Cromwell, on the other hand--not from religious sentiment, but
on purely political grounds--had Lutheran proclivities, owing to his
desire to conciliate Continental Protestantism. He did not, as Cranmer
did, urge the acceptance of views to which Henry objected; but his
influence was always in favour of “advanced” appointments, and of a lax
application of the laws which pressed hardly upon that school. Henry’s
personal affection for Cranmer, a liking for Latimer, and an absence
of any such feeling towards Gardiner and Gardiner’s colleagues, kept
him from active interference in this respect. But he saw to it that
what the law laid down should be unimpeachably orthodox, and every
attempt of Cromwell’s to draw nearer to the Lutherans was countered by
affirmations of a rigid adherence to the Old Faith and denunciation
of innovations: culminating in the Act of the Six Articles. The
differences in the formularies of faith issued from 1536 to 1540 are
all in the direction of increasing definiteness, of leaving fewer
questions open; and the definiteness is always in favour of the old
school. Although the minister officially supported the Six Articles,
while the Archbishop made all the fight possible against it, the Act
was the king’s deliberate work, and the forcing of it through was
without any possible doubt a direct set-back for Cromwell. At the same
time, however, Henry took occasion to impress on his Court, with his
usual vigour, that it would be extremely injudicious for any one to
act on the hypothesis that it involved any diminution of the personal
favour in which Cranmer was held.

In the rest of the domestic policy--Treason Acts, Supremacy Acts, Acts
of Succession, Dissolution of Monasteries, Attainders--there is no
opposition between king and minister. The edifice of absolutism with
the sanction of Parliament is steadily reared, on the ruins of the
ecclesiastical fabric and of the last families round whom any sort of
Yorkist tradition can centre. When at last it had culminated in the
Royal Proclamations Act, Cromwell ceased to be necessary; being no
longer necessary, he offended his master; and, offending him, fell as
Wolsey fell before him.


VII

HENRY’S CLOSING YEARS

Down to this point, then, from 1513 to 1540, we may believe that Henry
was the puppet first of Wolsey and then of Cromwell; or that both were
no more than the instruments of his supreme genius; or that, having
with a light heart delegated all his duties and cares to the Cardinal,
he resolved to rule himself, upset the Cardinal, and used Cromwell as
a tool and scapegoat. Or we may judge that the creative, designing
brains were his ministers’; but that he deliberately made their policy
his own, except when he had a fancy for diverging from it, trusting to
their pilotage just so long as it suited him--that they, not he, were
the pilots, but he was emphatically the captain. We may even believe
that the ministers were responsible only for the mistakes in execution,
the king for the great designs. But when Cromwell is gone no one takes
the vacant place. Gardiner and Norfolk are at the head of the Council,
which becomes a hotbed of intrigues; but it is quite impossible to
attribute the royal policy either to any individual or to any clique.
Hence, in the king’s conduct of affairs during the remaining six and a
half years of his life, we ought to find clues to the nature and extent
of the control he really exercised during the thirty years preceding.

The view here put forward has been, that Wolsey diverted him from his
first merely boyish dreams of martial achievements, to take hold of the
conception of making England stand as the secure arbiter between the
great Powers of the Continent, wooed by all--or both, when only two
were left--and able always to turn the scale if one or other threatened
to preponderate. His brain, however, being somewhat more liable to
inflation than the Cardinal’s, he compelled the latter, in pursuit of
this policy, to diverge from the right path and commit the country to
the French war--possibly, though not on the whole probably, with the
notion that the old grandiose idea of conquering France might become
practicable. Then, just as the blunder was in course of being remedied,
he became obsessed with the determination to divorce Katharine; a
proceeding which could hardly fail to make friendly relations with the
emperor so impossible as to destroy the basis of the balancing scheme,
which demanded that the two European rivals should both be anxious to
court English support. Then Cromwell showed him how to use the divorce
as a piece of the machinery by which the power of the Crown might be
made at least as absolute as any known in European history. He adopted
Cromwell’s plan, but not what Cromwell regarded as its corollary,
the acceptance of the position, and the alliance of the continental
Protestants: endeavouring to hold himself aloof from alliances, and,
after Katharine’s death, to regain the position of balance-holder.

Now it has been argued that the policy of 1522 was Wolsey’s own, not
the king’s policy forced on him, because it was only when Wolsey was
minister that a “spirited foreign policy” was acted upon. It is
therefore to be noted that when Henry was left to himself with neither
Wolsey nor Cromwell to give counsel, he did quite evidently take up
the almost defunct Plantagenet notion of imposing the sovereignty of
England on Scotland--which experience had shown to be no more feasible
than the conquest of France: and he did again find himself drawn into
an Imperial alliance, and actually at war with the French. These facts
do not amount to a proof, but they do afford a presumption that the
talk about recovering the French crown had not been altogether wind,
and that the first fighting alliance with Charles was, like the second,
the doing of the king. Probably Henry’s main motive in going into this
later French war was to compel Francis to withdraw his support from
the Scots. He ought, however, to have known by this time, first, that
France could not afford to stand by while Scotland was robbed of the
independence which was always a practical and valuable asset for France
when she was at war with England: and, secondly, that Charles would
play for his own hand, and would find some excuse for leaving his ally
isolated the moment his own needs were satisfied.

The Scots affair, by the way, supplies another interesting example
of the peculiarities of Henry’s conscience. The head and front of
the party in Scotland who were most bitterly hostile to England was
Cardinal Beton: who was in close alliance with Mary of Guise, the
queen-mother. Henry was ingenious enough to discover that Beton was a
rebel, who had secured himself above the reach of the law, and that
consequently his assassination would be rather commendable. It is not
surprising that the Cardinal was murdered in due course, and that the
murderers looked to England for support.

The history of these later years, in short, lends colour to the view
that the political errors--in foreign affairs--committed in Wolsey’s
days were forced on him by the king: and also that the king himself
did not formulate large political conceptions on his own account.
More than that, it shows him capable of such serious blunders as the
proposal to re-assert the old fable of English suzerainty in Scotland,
and--what was in its own way hardly less short-sighted--the wholesale
debasement of the coinage. It was not till he was left to manage things
with no strong counsellor to aid him that he gave way completely to
this most evil propensity of his last years. The thing did incalculable
mischief, ruining credit, driving up prices, robbing creditors for the
benefit of debtors, and, of course, driving all the sound coins out of
circulation. It is to the credit of Somerset in the next reign that,
in spite of the depleted treasury, he did not carry that disastrous
experiment further: it was left for Northumberland to degrade the
currency even more than Henry had done. And it was Henry who had done
it, not Wolsey or Cromwell or Gardiner. These things would seem to
mean that, left to himself, it was his tendency to resort to paltry
and short-sighted tricks and devices of a kind incompatible with the
higher statesmanship; tricks which seem at the moment to effect their
purpose, but are a mere evasion of the difficulties with which they
pretend to deal. In these years, Henry’s statesmanship makes a poor
display. We may plead on his behalf that physical disease weakened his
intellectual powers, that practically unchecked despotism produced
moral degeneration, that we cannot judge the qualities of a man whose
rule had been--for whatever reason--undeniably powerful for a quarter
of a century, by the mismanagement of the years when he was wearing
into his grave. There is truth in the plea. Yet from the degeneration
we can infer the inherent defects. The man who muddled his Scottish
policy, and left the arrangements for carrying on the government at
his death in a state of chaos, was not he who planned, organised, and
carried out the defiance of the Papal power and the subjection of the
Church; but he may have been perfectly capable of appreciating that
vast scheme, and of playing a formidable part in the execution of it.
On the other hand, had he been merely a vain tyrannical bully, there
was more than one man in his _entourage_ after Cromwell’s fall, who
would have had the wit to make a puppet of him--which no one certainly
succeeded in doing.


VIII

HENRY’S MARRIAGES

A study of Henry’s character, however brief, would be incomplete if it
omitted to touch on his widely varied marital relations. The Blue Beard
legend may by this time be fairly looked upon as exploded. He did not
marry one wife after another to gratify capricious passions, and, when
he was weary of the new toy, cut her head off and get himself another.
Except in the case of Anne Boleyn, and possibly Jane Seymour, passion
can have had very little to say to his various ventures. His Court was
licentious; but the king himself does not appear to have been worse
than his neighbours, even if he was no better. Political intriguers
tried to obtain influence through mistresses; there was certainly
an attempt to supplant Anne Boleyn by this means, and the Earl of
Surrey--who was probably innocent enough of real treason but otherwise
deserves very little of the pity that has been wasted on him--tried
to persuade his own sister to establish herself at the king’s ear in
the same way. There is hardly a shadow of doubt that Anne Boleyn’s
elder sister Mary was Henry’s mistress before he turned his eyes upon
Anne. Rumour declared, though the statement is not substantiated, that
Sir John Perrot, who did good work in Ireland in Elizabeth’s day,
was really Henry’s son. It is probable, however, that there were no
children of his born out of wedlock except the son of Elizabeth Blount,
whom he made Duke of Richmond and was credited with intending to get
legitimised, when there was no likelihood of a legitimate male heir
appearing. The state of the Court was such that Chapuys declined to
believe in the otherwise unimpeached virtue of Jane Seymour, merely
on the general principle that no woman could be supposed virtuous
under the conditions there prevalent--but Chapuys was writing at a
moment when he was feeling particularly hot against the whole Court.
An item in the royal accounts has been supposed to indicate that Henry
kept a sort of harem, but that is based on what is almost certainly a
misinterpretation of the term “mistress.” Henry was licentious enough,
but there is no reason to imagine him as a satyr, or as on the same
plane with Francis I. The kings of the sixteenth century, bad or good,
were not often clean livers. The way to Henry’s favour was never
through the good graces of the favourite of the hour; and except in the
case of Anne Boleyn it never appears that he allowed any passion to
interfere with his politics.

At eighteen, as soon as he ascended the throne, Henry married the
wife secured for him by the diplomacy of Henry VII. and Ferdinand and
the complaisance of the Pope. Katharine was four years the elder,
sufficiently good-looking, capable, and fit to be a queen. She had
already been the bride of the young king’s elder brother, who had died
very shortly after the nuptials: but the Pope had duly provided a
dispensation to permit the second marriage. She and her husband got on
satisfactorily enough for a time. In 1513, when he was displaying his
martial prowess in Picardy, she was occupied in organising the Flodden
campaign and wrote to him in a tone implying that they were excellent
friends: yet it is possible to recognise a certain want of tact, in
the absence of that adroit flattery which Henry’s vain soul loved,
when she dwells on her own achievements instead of praising those of
her lord. Henry soon grew cool--there is no reason to suppose that
he was ever her ardent lover--and already, when babies died or were
still-born, he seems to have turned his mind to a divorce, though he
dropped the idea again. When the princess Mary was born and did _not_
die, the big jovial monarch made a great pet of the child; and though
he was unfaithful to his wife, and had no compunction about it, the
conventional friendliness was maintained. There is no doubt that the
queen exercised active influence to secure England’s favour for her
nephew Charles V.; and critics have found, in the desire of Henry and
Wolsey, a few years later, to break with Charles and form an alliance
with France, one of the leading motives which recommended the divorce
to them.

About 1522, Anne Boleyn came to Court; and from this time, favours
began to flow in the direction of the Boleyn family. The probabilities
are, however, that as yet they were due rather to the complaisance of
the elder sister Mary than to the attractions of the younger. Four
years later, it is clear that Anne had become the object of the king’s
pursuit; but, whether because she was more virtuous or more ambitious
than Mary, Anne would not surrender herself. The king became the
victim of an absorbing passion, which made him determined to procure
the divorce from Katharine at any cost--whether or no it was primarily
responsible for reviving the idea. Once embarked on it, Henry was far
too obstinate to allow anything to divert him. Towards the end of
1532--as soon as Warham was dead--he saw his way. Before the year was
out, Anne had become his mistress or his wife; a marriage ceremony
was performed in January--possibly in November. It is not easy to
believe--though the evidence points that way--that Anne, after holding
out till the prize was actually in reach, would have risked everything
by yielding without insisting on the ceremony first taking place.

The marriage was extremely unpopular; the new queen was spiteful,
flighty, undignified, if nothing worse. In a very short time, Cranmer
was the only friend she had left; she lost her charm for her husband,
and she annoyed him by the same failure to fulfil his expectations
as Katharine. The old idea cropped up again, that on this as on the
previous union the blessing of heaven did not rest. The king found
himself attracted by the somewhat inconspicuous charms and persistent
virtue of Jane Seymour. Charges were brought against Anne, which may
or may not have been true; admissions were made to Cranmer, the nature
of which we can only guess at; on the strength of the former, she was
condemned to death for treason, and on the strength of the latter the
marriage was declared void _ab initio_. The unhappy woman was beheaded;
next day, according to Chapuys, the king married Jane Seymour
privately. The official marriage was ten days later.

Jane appears to have been a pleasing, colourless, irreproachable
person; who, when she had given birth to the much-desired son,
departed to another world without having suffered any estrangement
from her husband. He, however, was wife-hunting again before long--not
because he was attracted by any one, but for purely political ends.
Unfortunately he was not satisfied by the possession of purely
political qualifications on the part of the ladies, but offended their
susceptibilities by wishing to inspect them. At last Cromwell beguiled
him into approving the Cleves marriage; but when Anne came over, and
retreat seemed impossible, he first found that she was not at all to
his taste, and then that the political reasons for wedding her had been
quite inadequate. So the ecclesiastical lawyers set to work again to
discover an excuse for annulling that marriage; and in the meantime the
Duke of Norfolk produced a young niece of his own, Katharine Howard,
who took the king’s more than middle-aged fancy. Being quit of Anne,
he married the girl, who successfully cajoled him for about a year:
after which, the faction opposed to Norfolk discovered and laid before
the unfortunate husband evidence of undoubted immorality before and
probable immorality after her marriage. So Katharine Howard followed
Anne Boleyn to the block. The affair seems to have been a really
complete and very painful surprise to Henry.

By this time, the jibe attributed to the Duchess of Milan when Henry
was thinking of marrying her--“Had I two heads, one should be at his
majesty’s disposal”--would have been quite excusable. Even the ladies
of his own Court were not covetous of the queenly throne. Chapuys, ever
cynical, hinted that an Act passed at this time would quite account
for reluctance on their part: if the king should propose to marry a
subject, she must confess any improprieties of which she had been
guilty; otherwise, if they were subsequently discovered, she would be
held guilty of treason. Still Henry discovered one more lady who was
willing to take the risks--a lady of much conjugal experience, now a
widow for the second time. This was Katharine Parr, whose last husband
had been Lord Latimer. Her virtue, however, was as much above suspicion
as Jane Seymour’s had been; she was sensible, careful, and extremely
tactful; and when an attempt was made to set her husband against her as
a heretic, she satisfied him very easily, and her accuser had to submit
to one of Henry’s ratings. She survived him, and married Admiral Thomas
Seymour.

The marriages with Katharine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves were both
avowedly and professedly political. That with Anne Boleyn was one of
passion; that with Katharine Parr one of inclination. It is extremely
doubtful whether either was effectively promoted by political intrigue.
It is hardly at all doubtful that in the two remaining cases it was
political intrigue which brought both Jane Seymour and Katharine Howard
under the king’s notice; nevertheless, it is not likely that either
of these marriages affected the king’s policy, though the disastrous
termination of the second did so.


IX

HENRY’S CHARACTER

The end of Henry’s life was quite characteristic. For some time
beforehand every one knew that he could not last long; and intrigues
were rife to secure power when he was gone. The Earl of Hertford, Jane
Seymour’s brother, was at the head of that one of the two main factions
whose leading ecclesiastic was Cranmer; they were balanced by Gardiner,
with the old Duke of Norfolk and his son Henry Earl of Surrey. A false
move on Surrey’s part gave a handle to the enemy; Surrey was executed;
Norfolk was attainted and his life saved only by Henry’s own death;
Gardiner’s name was excluded from the council of “executors,” which is
supposed to have been intended by the king to balance the two parties.
Henry, left to himself, did not display wisdom in his government, but
he always at the worst held the reins in a fast grip and sat firm in
the saddle. His arrangements for carrying on the government after him
were short-sighted, and his successor in the saddle, Hertford, was
as much his inferior in practical mastery as he was superior in his
ethical aims. The results are discussed in another chapter. Henry was
almost _in articulo mortis_ before any one ventured to tell him that
his hours were numbered. At last he allowed Cranmer to be summoned.
When he arrived, the king was speechless; but being besought to give
some sign that he put his trust in Christ, wrung the Archbishop’s hand.
An hour afterwards, he was dead.

Henry’s career leaves a pretty wide option for forming a judgment of
his character. After making every possible allowance for flattery, we
know that he was exceptionally accomplished, cultured, athletic; he
could hold his own with any one, in an argument or in the tilt-yard.
His physical courage has been impugned, principally because in respect
of infectious diseases he was notoriously a coward. As a young
man, if he was unfaithful to his wife he at any rate observed the
expected courtesies; it is not surprising to find that as the divorce
proceedings went on his manner deteriorated, till his treatment of
Katharine, of his daughter Mary, of Anne Boleyn when she lost her
hold on him, can only be described as blackguardly. No one, perhaps,
would venture to ascribe to him a fervent zeal for religion; but he
was intensely satisfied with the rigidity of his own orthodoxy. It is
one of the many ironies of his career that his religiousness has been
praised exclusively by people whom he would have sent to the stake as
heretics without a moment’s hesitation. If he let Cranmer have his way
about an English Bible, it was not from an enthusiastic admiration of
the Scriptures, but because he knew that some of the clergy thought it
would weaken their influence. The nature of his own creed is conveyed
in the Act of the Six Articles. Of his “morality,” in the restricted
sense of that term, enough has already been said; it was that of his
age and his rank. For his conception of honour, his applications of
the Statute of _Præmunire_, and the return he rendered to Wolsey and
Cromwell and More for their services, are sufficient witness. In the
case of More, by the way, it was characteristic of him that when the
report of the ex-Chancellor’s execution was brought to him, he turned
on Anne Boleyn and told her it was all her doing. For a high-minded
man, his approval of the schemes for getting James Beton kidnapped
when under a safe-conduct, and for the murder of David Beton, seems a
little peculiar; yet in those times, it cannot be denied that similar
schemes found sanction in most unexpected quarters. As far as politics
were concerned, he kept his promises, on the whole, a shade more
loyally than Charles and Francis and their successors. Ferdinand and
Maximilian, of course, had never begun to think that promises could be
looked upon as binding.

As a statesman: we must reject the theory that he was merely a _Roi
Fainéant_ who liked to fancy that he was running the machine while he
was merely dancing to the tune called by cleverer men than himself:
we reject also the theory that the policy followed throughout was his
own creation, and that Wolsey and Cromwell stood in the same relation
to him as Morton and Fox to his father. He was not a far-seeing man
himself, but he knew a far-seeing man when he found one, having an
unfailing instinct for judging other men’s capacities and limitations,
intellectual and moral. He was ready to recognise their insight and
foresight, their organising and administrative powers, to lay the
burden--and the reproach--on their shoulders; but if they did not
convince his judgment, they had to obey his behests, not he theirs. And
yet there is one field wherein credit, and very high credit, attaches
to Henry--credit, moreover, which appears to be entirely his own. As
Wolsey had his hobby, education, so Henry had his hobby, the navy. A
Royal Navy, a fleet whose business was fighting, was practically his
creation. It may very well be that he was much wiser than he knew
himself in this matter--that his ships were to him something of a toy.
But what he did went far to making the glories of his daughter’s reign
possible, as the army of Frederick I. of Prussia made the army of
Frederick II. possible.

Finally; although we have denied him personally the greatest qualities
of statesmanship displayed by his ministers, he did possess in a
very high degree certain essential qualities of a successful ruler.
No mere blustering tyrant would have held England in his grip for
thirty-seven years; the annals of princes of that type may be
terrible, but they are brief. The masses may be held in subjection
by a powerful upper class for an indefinite period; the continued
power of an individual tyrant--of an active and resolutely aggressive
autocratic ruler--depends on his preserving the loyalty of the active
part of his subjects. That loyalty Henry retained; he never had the
smallest difficulty in stamping out every attempt at resistance. Mere
ruthlessness will not account for it; ruthlessness by itself rouses
new enemies: a reign of sheer terror is brief. To the instinct for
gauging men he added the instinct of gauging popular sentiment--a
perception of the line which must not be over-stepped; a knack of
gracious and timely withdrawal if ever he seemed to have passed the
danger-point. Withal, he recognised that the surest method of getting
his own way was to make his subjects believe that it was their way too.
His figure is very, very far from being god-like; it is quite remote
from the heroic; it might, however, have fairly been called Titanic, if
that term did not imply ultimate failure--for he did not fail. Neither
his intellectual nor his moral qualities permit us to love him, to
praise him, or to honour him; and yet, if we have read him aright, it
is impossible not to admire.




PROTECTOR SOMERSET


I

MISCONCEPTIONS

Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, was Protector and the most prominent
personality in English politics for a period only just exceeding two
years and a half. As Earl of Hertford, he grasped the reins of power
when Henry VIII. died; but since the fall of Thomas Cromwell, Henry had
reigned without allowing any of his servants to occupy a pre-eminent
position, and the Earl of Hertford had certainly not been an exception.
After his overthrow in the autumn of 1549, his political influence
was never strong enough to affect the measures of his successor: it
sufficed merely to bring about his own execution as a preventive
measure. The whole reign of Edward VI. is, in fact, quite sharply
divided into the two periods of the Seymour ascendency and the Dudley
ascendency; but the distinction somehow seems to be very commonly
overlooked, and Somerset is not only credited with his own doings or
misdoings, but with a goodly share of those for which Northumberland
was responsible, and with which Somerset was entirely out of sympathy.

It would appear, however, that it would be difficult to find two men
whose ideas were more thoroughly antagonistic than those of Somerset
and Northumberland: a view not very easily reconcilable with the
popular verdict, which seems to regard Somerset as being a weaker if
rather more amiable edition of his rival. It is certainly well that
the latest detailed study of the Protector’s career should have at
least sufficed to make the old method of treating him inexcusable
for the future. Without accepting all Mr. Pollard’s inferences as to
his subject’s abilities and character, it must be recognised that
the portrait presented in his _England under Protector Somerset_, if
somewhat “flattered,” will have to be seriously reckoned with by all
future historians of the period.

[Illustration: _PROTECTOR SOMERSET_

_From a Painting by_ HOLBEIN]

Nevertheless, it may be doubted whether the impression left by that
volume is quite what the author intended to convey. The suggestion
certainly is that the Protector was really a great man who only failed
because he was too much in advance of his age. But in fact, while he
possessed certain qualities essential to the great statesman though
by no means requisite for a successful politician, he lacked others
which are necessary to either character. Some of the projects for
which he laboured most strenuously were wrecked, not because they
were out of reach, but because of his own inherent incapacity for
adapting means to ends; and the general effect of his efforts was not
to bring the objects he had in view within nearer reach, but to make
them more difficult of attainment than they were before. Failure is no
condemnation. Wiclif failed, and Huss failed; but they made the
Reformation possible. Somerset failed, and there was hardly one of his
aims which had been advanced a single step by his action. A statesman,
to deserve the title in its full sense, must be an idealist in his
aims, but practical in his methods. The unpractical statesman may
deserve our sympathy and our admiration; but we may not therefore give
him the full meed of applause which belongs to the benefactors of the
race or nation. The unpractical idealist may be invaluable when he is a
voice only. When the control of public affairs falls into his hands, he
is a public danger.


II

THE PROTECTOR AND HIS PROBLEMS

Edward Seymour was born about 1505: of good family, but not of high
rank, though there was a strain of Plantagenet blood on the mother’s
side. At any rate, the Seymours were connected with the Court, and the
future Protector was still a boy when he was holding offices associated
with Royalties. When Henry VIII. tired of Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour was
the new spouse on whom his choice fell. The marriage naturally brought
advancement to her brother; and though she did not long survive the
birth of her son, Seymour, who had by this time been appointed to the
Privy Council and raised to the earldom of Hertford, continued to enjoy
favours as a man of undoubted talents and attractive personality--and
uncle of the heir apparent. Favours, however, meant very little in
the way of power. He discharged various functions and took part in
sundry military operations in France and Scotland; but apart from one
smart action near Boulogne, very little real credit attaches to his
performances, which consisted for the most part in sacking the city of
Edinburgh, and laying waste the Scottish border with rather more than
usual in the way of burning and devastation.

Such as they were, however, these achievements sufficed to bring
him some prestige as a commander. If there was nothing particularly
brilliant about them, the same comment applies generally to those of
his fellows and rivals. There was no one marked out by his talents
to take up the reins of government when the king should die and be
succeeded by a nine-year-old son. But it was fairly obvious that either
the Howards, or Hertford in virtue of his relationship to the young
Edward, must occupy the leading position. Intrigues and the folly of
Surrey turned the scale against the Howards; Surrey and his father were
both attainted; the former was executed and the latter escaped only
through Henry’s death. Hertford was inevitably the man of the hour.

There was no manner of doubt about the succession. Henry left only
one son, and that son’s legitimacy was unchallenged. But by a wholly
unique measure, Henry had been empowered to fix by will not only the
course of succession after his son but the method of carrying on the
government during Edward’s minority. The will, when produced, was
found to vest the control in a council of executors, giving priority to
none, but remarkable as excluding Bishop Gardiner from the list. The
genuineness of the document has been disputed, but probably without
sufficient reason. At any rate, as it stood, its provisions were very
far from satisfying Hertford’s ambitions, and it is hard to see how
any one could have had a personal interest in giving it such a shape.
Certainly he had none, and his immediate efforts were directed to
inducing the new Council to alter its own constitution fundamentally.
For two days the king’s death was kept secret, while Hertford laid
his plans in conjunction with Paget, who had possession of the will.
When the Council was summoned and the will produced, a proposal was
immediately sanctioned appointing Hertford Lord Protector of the realm
and of the king’s person. The assent of the king and the peers was
formally obtained, and a few weeks later the appointment was confirmed
by the king’s authority under the Great Seal. In the interval there had
been a general distribution of honours, Hertford himself being made
Duke of Somerset. Also the one member of the Council from whom serious
opposition was to be feared, Wriothesley the Lord Chancellor (now
made Earl of Southampton), justified his own removal by transgressing
his powers. Somerset’s position was thus for the time at least made
impregnable.

Henry VIII. himself and his second great minister Cromwell had
conducted the government of the country on autocratic lines under
colour of parliamentary forms, until Parliament itself assigned, not
to the Crown as such, but to Henry personally, what amounted to the
power of legislation by Royal Proclamation. Somerset, though without
this statutory power, continued to make a free use of proclamations,
such being in effect the system to which the country had become
accustomed. He did not appreciate the change which had taken place. For
the successful exercise of those powers a personality was needed which
commanded unquestioning obedience, coupled with an unerring sense of
the limits of endurance in the subjects. In neither respect was the
Protector endowed with the necessary qualities.

There were problems enough to be dealt with to have daunted a master
of statecraft. Over the Channel, there was France, aggrieved because
England was just now holding Boulogne in pawn. The veteran Francis I.
followed his English contemporary and rival to the grave in a very
few weeks, and the son who succeeded him was by no means friendly to
England. Across the northern border there was Scotland, with a baby
queen, a queen-mother who was one of the Guise family who were in
the ascendant in France, and a dominant party which in its national
sympathies was French, and, in the religious point of view, regarded
Henry as a schismatic and all advocates of the Reformation as heretics.
At home, it was quite certain that the removal of Henry’s heavy hand
would be followed by a renewal of the strife in the Church between
the followers of the “Old Learning,” headed by Gardiner, Bonner and
Tunstal, and those of the New, whose chief was Archbishop Cranmer. In
addition, there was a grave social problem.

For a full half century a steady process had been at work throughout
rural England of extending sheep-farming at the expense of cultivation.
It was a process which paid the land-owners, owing to the large demands
from abroad for English wool. But it was not equally satisfactory to
the agricultural labourer, who was deprived of his customary employment
(since sheep-farming required far fewer hands) and found no adequate
compensation as yet in the industrial growth of towns. The evil was
aggravated by the iniquitous manner in which landholders systematically
seized every opportunity of appropriating common lands. In the main,
this was the outcome of natural economic tendencies, which repeated
attempts at legislative interference entirely failed to hold in check.
But these troubles had been directly intensified by the action of
Henry’s government for more than ten years past. The dissolution of
the monasteries had deprived the peasantry of an easy-going and on
the whole kindly group of landlords, and replaced these by another
group who were generally greedy and rapacious. Moreover, the wholesale
and monstrous debasement of the coinage, an expedient to which Henry
had been driven by the depletion of the exchequer caused by his
extravagance, had brought about a corresponding drop in effective
wages, besides shaking financial stability and commercial confidence,
with the unfailing disastrous results. From all of which, wide-spread
misery and want were prevalent, more particularly in the rural
districts.

These problems, we have said, might well have daunted even a master of
statecraft. But for each of them the sanguine duke had his solution.
It was with no mere paltry self-seeking designs that he had grasped
at power. He had elected himself to the office of saviour of society:
to the great disgust of some of those members of the Council who had
connived at his elevation, in the confident belief that his interests
and their own were identical, and would be the first objects at which
his government would aim.


III

SOMERSET AND SCOTLAND

At the outset, it was to Scotland that the Protector gave his attention.

Two hundred years before the first Tudor ascended the throne of
England, one of the ablest rulers this country has known realised
that the union of England and Scotland as a single nation was an
eminently desirable object. He sought to achieve that object by force
of arms. He conquered Scotland, and Scotland rebelled. Every time he
reconquered her, she rebelled again. His last attempt at invasion was
foiled by his own death, and during the reign of his incompetent son,
Scotland finally and decisively threw off the yoke he had attempted to
impose. Every subsequent attempt to reimpose that yoke was foiled.
Scottish barons might and did take pay from English kings, but in
general terms it is safe to say that the expectation of an attempt at
the armed conquest of the northern country was the one thing which
could effectively, if only temporarily, induce the factions of the
Scottish nobility to lay aside their personal and family feuds, and
unite in resistance to the Southron. Another method of reconciliation
had attracted the astute Henry VII., who married his eldest daughter
to the Scots king--not indeed with the definite expectation that a
union of the two crowns would result, but still with the _arrière
pensée_ that such a result was not impossible. From the fatal day of
Flodden till the death of Henry VIII., Scotland had been alternately
the prey of rival factions, and the English king had found that the
simplest way of keeping his northern neighbours from becoming dangerous
was to foster those rivalries. He had gone out of his way to prevent
his elder sister’s offspring from inheriting the English throne, by
postponing their claims in his will to those of her younger sister’s
descendants. But he had on the one hand been favourably disposed to the
idea that his own boy should marry the infant queen of Scots when the
two were old enough; and he had more than once implicitly, if not quite
explicitly, asserted the old claim of English suzerainty, with a view
to the ultimate subjection of the Scottish to the English crown if it
should prove convenient to try enforcing it.

Now at the moment of Henry’s death there was a party in Scotland which
depended for its chance of success very largely on English aid. This
was the Protestant section, which had just recently accomplished the
murder of Cardinal Beton. The Catholics looked to France and the
queen-mother’s Guise kinsfolk for support. Various important persons
were as usual quite ready to take either side, as opportunity might
render convenient. But the assassins of the Cardinal were still in
possession of the Castle of St. Andrews. It seemed clear that if
England gave active support to this section and prevented the arrival
of reinforcements to the other party from France, English influence
would predominate. If St. Andrews fell, the French party would acquire
complete ascendency.

Somerset had no lack of political imagination. The idea of the union
with Scotland appealed to him very strongly indeed. A less enthusiastic
advocate of that policy might very well have been content to let things
drift, reckoning that at worst Scotland would be no more willing
to submit to a French than to an English domination, and that the
moment of the almost inevitable anti-French reaction would be the
time for a _rapprochement_. Scotland might after all be postponed
to matters that were more immediately pressing. But there was an
obvious alternative--to espouse the cause of the Protestant leaders
in Scotland, confirm them as a heartily Anglophil party thoroughly
committed at least to the English alliance, and establish them in a
secure ascendency.

Neither of these courses, however, would achieve the solution on
which the Protector was bent--the union of the two countries under a
single Crown. It was true that there were plenty of Scots who in the
abstract regarded such a union as desirable, and had expressed approval
of the particular means proposed to that end--the marriage of Edward
and Mary. If the sexes of the children had been reversed, the scheme
might have run smoothly enough. But the Scottish idea of a union meant
a union on equal terms, and anything which pointed to a danger of the
smaller country being subordinated to the larger was apt to kindle a
fierce flame of opposition. It would require a great deal of diplomatic
tact to convince the Scottish nation at large that the contemplated
marriage would not be turned to account so as to subordinate Scotland.
If England now took up the cause of the Protestants, it was more than
probable that when they were in power they would find sufficient
reasons for evading the marriage. The Scots lords who had expressed
approval were already making it clear that they did not intend to be
bound by their past declarations.

Somerset desired the union by assent. But if the Scots would not
assent, he meant to enforce it. The object in view was excellent, the
method was ruinous. He saw nothing for it but invasion. The castle
of St. Andrews fell, and the party friendly to England lost ground.
Somerset dropped hints about the old claim of suzerainty, and Scottish
indignation grew. His own previous record in Scotland did not encourage
confidence in his good intentions. Early in September, Somerset crossed
the border at the head of a large army. It availed nothing that the
Scots army was completely shattered at Pinkie Cleugh--a defeat due to
the same blunder which had given Surrey the victory at Flodden and was
to give Cromwell the victory at Dunbar, as well as to the superiority
in artillery of the smaller English army--and that Edinburgh was again
sacked. Somerset’s plans had not extended to preparing an army of
occupation. The principal effect of the invasion, in strict accordance
with unvarying precedent, was to set the whole of Scotland in fierce
opposition to the union, with the result that shortly afterwards little
Queen Mary was embarked on French ships and carried off to France,
to be placed under the care of her Guise uncles and betrothed to the
French Dauphin, while the Guise ascendency in Scotland was confirmed.

Had the Protector been actuated mainly by a desire to achieve
popularity, the Pinkie campaign would have been a brilliant success.
But his aims were far higher. His conception of a union with Scotland
was so far in advance of his times that it was not even realised by the
union of the crowns in 1603, or until the Treaty of Union in 1707, more
than 150 years later. That in itself is sufficient to demonstrate that
his statesmanship had its quite admirable side. On the other hand, the
means by which he endeavoured to secure those aims were absolutely the
worst that could have been devised. The Pinkie campaign placed them
more completely and hopelessly out of reach than any inaction or any
other measures he could possibly have contrived. That is sufficient
to explain why his government was on the whole so disastrous. He had
thrown Scotland into the arms of France, and made France herself more
instead of less hostile to England.


IV

SOMERSET’S RELIGIOUS POLICY

The Protector’s praiseworthy desire for a union with Scotland was in
part at least subsidiary to his enthusiasm for the Reformation. The
desire to see Scotland Protestant as well as England was one of his
motives, and a strong one. And for his efforts in the cause of the New
Learning in England he deserves more praise and less censure than is
usually accorded to him. The historians with what may be called the
anti-Protestant bias rarely distinguish between what was done under his
rule and what was done under that of his successor in power. Those with
a Protestant bias are apt to condemn him as lukewarm. Very rarely is
it realised that under his government a degree of toleration prevailed
such as was never contemplated by other Protestant rulers of his times,
still less by Catholic princes. Yet here as in all else his work was
marred by his lack of judgment, and still more--unhappily--by personal
defects in his character.

The religious problem was obviously the most prominent of those which
demanded solution on the death of Henry VIII. That monarch had broken
with the Papacy, revolutionised the relations of the State and the
ecclesiastical organisation in England, dissolved the monasteries,
appropriated their revenues, condemned a few superstitious practices,
and authorised a version of the Scriptures in the vernacular. There
he had stopped. No dogmatic innovations had been admitted, and a
large number of practices which moderate as well as extreme reformers
desired to see altered had been retained. Obedience had been enforced
by stringent legislation, and the Six Articles Act was a standing
menace to innovators. Still, if in his later years Henry refused to go
forward, he also declined to go backward. The party of reaction, when
they attempted to subvert Cranmer’s position in the royal favour, only
got a sharp reprimand for their pains. Yet the Reformation had reached
a stage at which standing still had become impossible.

In framing the list of his executors, it seems as though the king’s
intention had been to preserve a balance, with a slight leaning towards
the forward school; a leaning which would almost have been reversed if
Gardiner had been included. Cranmer was balanced by Tunstal, Hertford
by Wriothesley. Dudley, Herbert, and Russell, were avowedly on the
Protestant side. Others were pronounced supporters of the old order,
and others again like Paget would be guided by circumstances. The
moment, however, that Hertford’s ascendency was assured, it was quite
certain that the forward movement would be set on foot. Cranmer took in
the pulpit the earliest opportunity of likening the boy-king to Josiah,
thereby very definitely fore-shadowing a war against “images.”

Nevertheless, there was nothing in the way of a violent revolution
instituted. Broadly speaking, measures of which Cranmer had openly
avowed himself in favour during the late king’s reign were resorted to
perhaps more hastily than was wise. The Archbishop’s Book of Homilies
received the sanction which Henry had refused to it. Injunctions based
on those of Thomas Cromwell were issued, chiefly directed against
“abused images,” and a visitation by Royal Commission was presently set
on foot. While Somerset was still in Scotland, Gardiner and Bonner, the
bishops of Winchester and London, offered some opposition on the ground
that these measures were inconsistent with the later ecclesiastical
legislation of Henry; and both were placed under easy confinement in
the Fleet. So far, however, there was nothing which could be called
innovation; there was merely a renewal of Cromwell’s activity on the
same lines--accompanied in practice by very much the same irreverence
and violence.

When Convocation and Parliament met for the winter, there was no
appearance of any violence being done to ecclesiastical consciences.
All the bishops were Henry’s bishops, not Somerset’s; and though
they did not prove unanimous in Parliament, a majority of them were
favourable to the reforming measures introduced--with the exception
of the Chantries Act, which was in itself quite obviously nothing
but the completion of an approved policy. Acts for the suppression
of irreverent language about the Sacrament, and enjoining the
administration of the Communion in both kinds, were passed actually at
the instance of the clergy themselves, while the clerical demand for
permission to marry was ignored. The Six Articles Act was repealed,
but that was nothing more than an abolition of penalties, like the
accompanying repeal of the statutes _de heretico comburendo_. During
1548, there were proclamations enjoining the Lenten fast, for the
sake of the fisheries; an Order of service for Communion was issued,
which, however, only gave effect to the recent Act; there was a fresh
Injunction against Images; preaching was restricted to the Homilies,
except for licensed preachers--a custom frequently enforced in the last
reign. In form, there was still no innovation.

In the winter of 1548-9 came the First Prayer Book of Edward VI., and
the Act of Uniformity. The Prayer Book was a compromise, which admitted
of such divergent interpretation that the most and the least advanced
of the bishops could use it without straining their consciences: and
the Act of Uniformity, while it penalised disobedience on the part of
the clergy, laid no burden whatever upon laymen.

Now we have here reviewed summarily the whole of the ecclesiastical
legislation for which Somerset was responsible. On the face of it,
the changes he introduced were by no means revolutionary. Even the
new Prayer Book in effect required no one to accept any new doctrine.
The repeal of penal acts practically permitted but assuredly did not
enforce the teaching of the doctrines against which they had been
directed. Not a single victim was sent to the stake; not a single
bishop was deprived of his See. During Somerset’s absence in Scotland,
Gardiner and Bonner were placed in confinement for disobeying the
Injunctions. Both were released after some three months. Again, the
next year, Gardiner adopted a critical attitude which led to his being
imprisoned again in what was no doubt a high-handed fashion; and
almost at the moment of the Protector’s fall, Bonner was again sent to
prison for disobeying the Act of Uniformity. There is only one other
act of persecution charged to Somerset which even calls for comment,
the condemnation of Joan Bocher; and that is only to remark that as a
matter of fact it was after his fall that her execution was sanctioned.
It was not till he had been ousted from power by Dudley that the
zealots dominated the reforming party.

Nevertheless, in this field also the Protector failed, and brought
discredit both on his measures and his motives. On his measures,
because those which were in themselves the most questionable and the
most unpopular were, so to express it, not statutory but proclamatory:
exercises of a power which was of extremely doubtful legality,
arbitrary in their nature. On his motives, because he made large
personal profits out of the spoils of the Church (though a far larger
proportion of these was appropriated to education than in the preceding
reign), and set an evil example of sacrilege by laying hands upon
sacred edifices and pulling them down for the building of a palace for
himself. In his policy, which was moderate and most unusually tolerant,
he worked hand-in-hand with the Archbishop, so that it is difficult
to say which of the two was the guiding spirit; yet its effect was in
great part--though not, as in the case of Scotland, totally--destroyed
by the mistaken methods he chose to adopt for enforcing it.


V

SOMERSET AND THE SOCIAL PROBLEM

We have studied the Protector in his character as prophet of the union
with Scotland, and as apostle of religious tolerance. We have now to
observe him in his third _rôle_ as friend of the people; wherein again
he was equally honest in his pursuit of an ideal, equally satisfied of
his own competence to deal with the problem, and equally misguided in
his methods.

No man, whatever his office, can be reproached for having failed to
solve the eternal problems of poverty and unemployment. The enormous
discrepancies in the distribution of wealth may appeal to the wealthy
as evidence of divine justice; by the poor they are more apt to be
attributed to human injustice. Yet it is not always apparent on the
face of things that the rich man has become rich or the poor man poor
through any misdoings. Natural forces operate without any regard to
abstract equity. There are always, however, those who, passionately
alive to the unfairness of the inequalities around them, are convinced
that there is nothing to prevent the realisation of a Utopian
rectification except the selfish greed of the propertied classes, and
imagine that an adequate remedy can be found in the imposition of paper
rules and regulations. Selfish greed is always one of the factors in
the problem, of varying magnitude, and regulations which effectively
protect the weak instead of strengthening the strong may have most
beneficial results; but they must have a power behind them which is
capable of enforcing them, and they must be in themselves capable of
being enforced.

The social disorganisation at this period was exceptionally acute.
For the agricultural depression, we have already noted as the most
vital cause the conversion of arable land into pasture--the growing
substitution of a highly remunerative industry demanding little labour
for a less remunerative industry requiring more labour. Next to this
was the disappearance of small holdings, owing to their accumulation
into single large estates--the substitution in effect of large farms
worked by farm servants for petty cultivation by peasant households.
Third stands the enclosing and appropriation of common lands by large
landholders. The demand for labour sinking from these causes out of
all proportion to the supply, cheapened labour excessively. There was
an army of men who could find no employment, and those who obtained
employment were miserably paid. Of the three causes named, only the
third can be attributed to the moral obliquities of the wealthy. The
other two were natural economic developments which would in the course
of time find their natural remedy in the growth of new industries
which would absorb the displaced labour. That, however, did not make
the existing distress less painful, since the new industries had not
yet come into being. Moreover, whereas in the old days the monasteries
had at least played some part in the immediate relief of distress,
though they had not mitigated its causes, their destruction had
abolished this source of relief. We have in our own day an analogous
movement in the industrial world, public companies and trusts absorbing
the business of the small traders, while the channels into which
capital flows are decided by considerations not of philanthropy but of
dividends.

The true remedy was to be found--and was found in the course of
Elizabeth’s reign--in the development of new industries; and the
condition of developing new industries was the restoration of public
credit: to be achieved primarily by steady government, establishing
general confidence, and by ending one grave cause of the existing
lack of credit for which the recent government had been directly
responsible, namely, the debasement of the coinage. It was also not
impracticable, though exceedingly difficult, to deal with the thievery
of common lands. Incidentally, it was necessary to find a substitute
which should discharge the charitable functions of the monasteries,
as well as to hold in check the vagabondage which, owing to the great
number of the unemployed, was a daily increasing danger.

There were, then, certain practical steps to be taken which would
not indeed cure the existing evils, but would serve directly to
mitigate them and to restore the body politic to a condition in which
the only effective remedy could be applied. But in the sixteenth
century, even the most scientific thinkers believed that human nature
could be “expelled with a fork” by statute: and it is small blame to
Somerset that he sought to stay the economic tide and to forbid the
inevitable. The attempt was very much more than anything else the
cause of his ruin; and as usual it was dictated by the most excellent
motives. But it is very much to be lamented that while he attempted the
impracticable, he left what was practicable alone, or mismanaged it so
far as he did try it. He could not provide the country with a steady
government: he did not restore the currency: public credit sank. He
pinned his faith on legislation which was either flatly rejected or
became a dead letter the moment it was passed. He made an attempt to
deal with vagabondage by converting vagabonds into slaves, which was
merely grotesque. Dissatisfied--quite properly--with the courts which
dealt with the land questions, he established a “Court of Requests”
in his own house, and proposed on his own responsibility to overrule
their decisions. As for the enclosure business, the Council was not
merely unsympathetic; half its members were more or less flagrant
enclosers themselves. For Somerset to make a direct frontal attack on
the system on which they were battening was creditable to his courage,
but it was not politics. When they found that the Protector was not
merely playing at being a popular ruler, but was taking himself very
seriously indeed, and that he evinced anything but the proper desire to
pulverise the Commons when they rose in arms either in the western or
the eastern counties, they were not long in deciding that the Protector
himself must go. They were only following immemorial custom when they
put forward the theory that he was seeking his own advancement by
practising the arts of the demagogue, and that the rural unrest was the
creation of his machinations.


VI

THE LORD ADMIRAL

The same characteristics of the Protector present themselves in other
fields. His motives were quite other than those which actuated the
government which succeeded his, and on an altogether higher plane. We
have already noted in passing that his scheme for religion included
the repeal of the Act of the Six Articles and the old penal statutes
_de heretico comburendo_; that is, his policy abolished the methods
of persecution, at least in any stringent form. In precisely the same
spirit, he dealt with the Treason Laws invented under Henry VIII. and
used by that monarch with such terrible effect. Those laws were a very
potent weapon in the hands of an arbitrary ruler; an instrument by
which virtually the king--or, if the king so chose, his minister--could
absolutely secure the condemnation for high treason of any person
who in any way proved obnoxious to his government. To that end it was
practically sufficient to procure an information that the proposed
victim had used expressions which might be construed as implying a
possibility of treasonous intent, or of complicity in treasonous
intent--treasonous intent being interpreted in the widest conceivable
sense--and the victim’s doom was sealed, whether he were a Buckingham,
a More, or a Surrey. This weapon lay ready to the Protector’s hand for
the destruction of rivals and the establishment of his own authority.
He not only declined to use it; he broke it to pieces himself. It is
particularly noteworthy that it was in Somerset’s Act of 1547 that a
provision was first introduced requiring that any charge of treason
should be supported by two witnesses--a provision repeated in the
later Treasons Act of Northumberland. The Protector deliberately and
of set purpose deprived himself of those means to tyranny which Thomas
Cromwell had so carefully fabricated.

Again, we find during his rule that there was no coercing of
Parliament, no interference with freedom of debate, no danger attending
on the most outspoken opposition to the personal wishes of the
Protector.

Yet here, again, he gave occasion to the enemy. If he had maintained
the Cromwellian system of ruthlessness in the pursuit of each object
he set before himself, his condemnation as a tyrant would have been
tempered by praise of his masterfulness. The policy of blood and iron
always has its advocates, and sometimes merits advocacy. But it was not
Somerset’s policy, and therefore the one occasion on which he deserted
his practice attracts criticism. On that one occasion there is very
little doubt that he had an irresistible case. It is scarcely necessary
to add that he did the thing the wrong way.

His brother William, created Lord Seymour of Sudely under the new
administration, was also Lord High Admiral. But, as the king’s uncle,
he was by no means satisfied with the honours which fell to his share,
and was extremely jealous of his brother’s absorption of dignities
and power. He plunged in a series of intrigues to get the young king
under his own personal influence, and to bring the two younger girls,
Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey, who might come into the succession,
under his own control. He began by secretly marrying Katharine Parr,
the king’s widow, for whose hand he had been a suitor before Henry had
chosen her for his sixth matrimonial venture: so that his wife had
precedence over Somerset’s Duchess. Elizabeth, being under her charge,
was thus brought into the Admiral’s household. He bribed Dorset,
whose wife under Henry’s will stood next in succession to Henry’s own
offspring, to place their daughter Jane under his tutelage also. He
put forward a claim that, as the king’s uncle, he was entitled to be
governor of the king’s person instead of his brother, who was Protector
of the realm--a claim in which he was unsupported. He consistently set
himself in opposition to his brother, doing everything in his power to
thwart him, and refusing to command the fleet which accompanied the
invasion of Scotland. Katharine Parr died within eighteen months of
her marriage, and no sooner was she in her grave than he attempted to
obtain the hand of Elizabeth, now a girl of barely fifteen years: to
whom his behaviour had already been so objectionable that Katharine had
found it necessary to remove her out of his reach. As Admiral, instead
of repressing the pirates who infested the Channel, he made private
league with them for their support--and for shares in their booty.
He kept something like a small army of bravoes in his pay, and had a
private cannon-foundry of his own; and he found the means for the heavy
expenditure entailed through a pact with Sharrington, the master of the
mint at Bristol, who was pocketing enormous and iniquitous profits out
of the clipping and debasing of the coins he issued.

With Henry on the throne, or a Thomas Cromwell at the head of the
State, the Lord Admiral would have been in the Tower in two months.
Under the Protectorate, he was allowed to carry on his intrigues
and malpractices for two years, with nothing more serious than
remonstrances. The discovery, however, of Sharrington’s frauds and
Seymour’s implication therein brought matters to a head. The evidence,
not only of an abuse of his office which amounted to treason, but
of an ulterior intention of subverting the Government, was ample
enough, though the only prominent men who were in any sense attached
to him were Dorset and Northampton (the latter being Katharine Parr’s
brother). There is hardly a question that, in open trial, under the
most favourable conditions, the Admiral would have been sentenced and
executed. Unfortunately for his own credit, Somerset assented to
the view of the Council that the process should be by attainder in
Parliament instead. Seymour stood on his right to an open hearing, and
refused to answer the interrogatories of committees of the Council or
of the Peers; and therefore he was condemned, by the almost unanimous
verdict of both houses, unheard. The natural result was that men said
at the time, and have continued to say since, that the Protector,
fearing that his brother might become a dangerous rival, fabricated
charges against him, and in effect contrived one more of the political
murders of the type so familiar in the annals of Henry VIII. The
Admiral was executed in March. His death was undoubtedly a shock to
popular sentiment, and weakened Somerset’s position, so that his fall
followed the more easily after the rural risings which turned the
majority of the Council decisively against him.


VII

THE EX-PROTECTOR

The Council’s _coup d’état_ cost very little trouble. The moment was
seized, when the unsuspecting Somerset was at Hampton Court, Cranmer
and Paget being absent; while Russell and Herbert were returning
with victorious laurels and most of the available army from the
suppression of the Western rising. Both of them had strong feelings
as to Somerset’s Enclosures policy. After a futile appeal to the
people, there was nothing to do but surrender. But the Duke was at
any rate a popular favourite; a good many of those who were in the
plot against him liked him well enough personally though his policy
annoyed them; he was not of the stuff of which successful political
plotters are made; there was no plausible excuse for treating anything
that he had done as proving anything worse than incompetence; and the
Council were satisfied by his being turned out of office, subjected to
a brief imprisonment, and deprived of no great amount of his lands.
Six months after his fall he was even readmitted to the Privy Council,
as Southampton had been three years before. There was, in short, no
display of animosity; but the Warwick faction meant to grasp the
management of public affairs, and to conduct them with more profit to
themselves than the Protector’s _régime_ permitted.

Warwick and his friends--the Earl did not get himself created Duke of
Northumberland till two years later--took over the control in October
1549. They retained it for a little less than four years. During that
time their foreign and Scottish policy showed no improvement upon
that of Somerset. In matters of religion, they progressed from the
Prayer-book of 1548-49 to that of 1552: which would have been of a
more pronounced Calvinistic flavour than it was but for the moderating
influence of Ridley and Cranmer. Bonner and Gardiner were both deprived
of their sees at the beginning of the _régime_, and later Tunstal,
Day, and Heath were also imprisoned and deprived. The new appointments
were all advanced Reformers. Before Somerset’s fall the Princess Mary
had been attacked for persisting in the use of the Mass in private,
after the Act of Uniformity, but the Protector granted her a licence
to continue. The Warwick government was not similarly complaisant. And
when a second Act of Uniformity was passed, of a much narrower type
than the first, laymen as well as clergy were penalised for failure
to conform. In dealing with the rural troubles Somerset’s policy was
reversed, legislation being directed to the coercive repression of
discontent and the relaxation of such safeguards as existed against the
rapacity of landlords. To this must be added their new treason law,
which not only extended the same protection to all Privy Councillors as
to the king himself, but also made assemblies “for altering the laws”
high treason, while renewing the requirement of two witnesses as well
as of a time-limit which Somerset had introduced.

Yet there are historians who say that there is no need to differentiate
between the policy of Somerset and his successor--associating them in
the same condemnation.

Somerset, restored to liberty and formally reconciled to Warwick,
consistently endeavoured to use his influence in mitigation of the
rigours of the new Government, whose chief began to fear, not without
reason, that the moderate men might draw together and reinstate his
rival. Paget, whose abilities made him dangerous, was removed from
the Council, and imprisoned on an inadequate pretext in the autumn of
1551, to simplify the carrying out of Warwick’s plot; evidence of
an alleged conspiracy was carefully concocted, Somerset and several
of his friends were arrested, and the torture--never employed by the
Protector--was resorted to for the extraction of confessions from
some of the prisoners. A mythical assassination plot was dropped out
of the indictment. Finding that even the concocted evidence was quite
inadequate for a conviction of treason, Northumberland magnanimously
declined to press personal charges, and Somerset was found guilty of
felony--apparently on the ground that he had incited the citizens of
London to rebellion--by a carefully packed court.

Having been acquitted of treason, but--with equal satisfaction to
Northumberland, since the penalty was the same--condemned for felony,
the axe borne by Somerset’s gaolers was reversed when he was taken
from the judgment-hall. The crowds which had gathered to await the
verdict were thus misled into the belief that the trial had gone in
his favour, and broke into a clamour of rejoicing. It was a fond
illusion. Even when his doom was made known the populace refused to
believe that it would be carried out. The Duke himself knew better.
As he stood on the scaffold, having already pronounced his moving and
dignified dying speech, a messenger was seen approaching, and a wild
cry arose--a delighted shout that he was carrying a pardon. Somerset
hushed the people, warning them it was no such thing, and bidding them
pray with him for the King’s Majesty. Then, with the words “Lord Jesus,
save me,” he laid his head on the block to receive the fatal stroke:
and the spectators hastened to dip their kerchiefs in his blood, to be
preserved as memorials of one who, with all his faults, had won the
heart’s love of the common folk.

Somerset’s personal faults were shared by the majority of the prominent
men of his time; it was only the greatness of his position which
made them a shade more conspicuous in him. As a statesman, he was a
melancholy failure; _capax imperii_ he was not in any possible sense;
and his incapacity was only the more conclusively proved by the fact
that he never suspected it himself. The shrewdest of men would have
found it difficult enough to realise his aims, and of shrewdness he
had not a particle. His failure was due not less to his complete lack
of judgment than to the difficulties inherent in the problems which
with easy confidence he set himself to solve. It was an ill thing for
England that he was not a wiser man. But it had been well for England
if wiser men than he had possessed more of those moral qualities of his
to which he himself so woefully failed to give effect.




ARCHBISHOP CRANMER


I

INTRODUCTORY

The Protector Somerset accounted himself a statesman. Of his own
choice, he grasped at power; and being unfitted for it, he broke
down disastrously. Thomas Cranmer affords a striking contrast.
He was dragged into the turmoil of public affairs, in the vortex
of the Reformation; against his will, he was compelled to
accept ecclesiastical responsibilities which were in themselves
semi-political, and to play a part also in affairs which were political
exclusively. In the second capacity, he never assumed the direction,
but was merely called upon to assent to the actions of others; but
as archbishop he was compelled willy nilly to be a protagonist in
the religious revolution--a term covering not only changes in the
authorised doctrines of the Church and the authorised practices of the
clergy, but in the relations of the clerical organisation in England
both to the clerical organisation of Christendom and the secular powers
at home.

[Illustration: _THOMAS CRANMER_

_From a Painting by_ G. FLICCIUS _in the National Portrait Gallery_]

In the eyes of an earnest school of ecclesiastical critics, he proved
himself a traitor to the sacred trust which was imposed on him; a
time-serving tool of lay usurpers; who, if he had convictions, lacked
the courage of them, disowning all that he had most strongly avowed
to save himself from the stake; and only at the last in some measure
redeeming himself by a belated and almost incomprehensible courage in
the hour of his doom. Ardent Protestants endorse half the charges,
and condemn him as at best a Laodicean, though one who found grace
at the eleventh hour. And historians who display no marked bias on
the ecclesiastical questions are apt almost to pass him by, with
contemptuous reference to his weakness and subserviency. Still there
are not a few who have studied his career with care and sympathy; and
their verdict is by no means the one conventionally accepted. It would,
indeed, be strange and sad if such a verdict gave a true account of
the man who did more than any other individual, on the one hand, to
preserve the continuity of the Church, while, on the other hand, he
strove to make her comprehensive and national. To no one, indeed, can
he assume the proportions of a master-spirit; but the more closely
we study him, the more readily we recognise in him a pre-eminently
gentle and charitable soul, simple and sincere, striving to do his duty
through good and evil report, in a task which he would fain have left
to men who were not--as he was--born to be students, not fighters; and
actually accomplishing what men of far greater practical ability would
have deemed it vain to attempt. If it was better for England that the
Church should be what it became than that it should have taken the
shape into which either a Gardiner or a Knox would have moulded
it, it was well for England that for twenty years Cranmer was her
foremost ecclesiastic.


II

CRANMER AT CAMBRIDGE

Thomas Cranmer was born not two years before Henry VIII., in 1489;
the son of a country gentleman of no great estate. An elder son
was to carry on the family; Thomas and his younger brother were
destined to the Church. The younger sons of a country gentleman of
straitened means had no very encouraging prospects, and the career
chosen for the boy was, no doubt, dictated merely by convenience,
though it was well enough suited to his talents and temperament.
Somewhat lacking, perhaps, in that cheerful heedlessness of danger
and physical pain which is the happy heritage of the normal English
boy--the outcome often of rude health and imperturbable nerves rather
than of any properly moral endowment--a certain timidity and want of
self-confidence in him were evidently fostered by the unsympathetic
severity of a pedagogue whose theory of education was, a stick with a
master at one end and a boy at the other. In due course he went up to
the recent foundation of Jesus College, Cambridge, and was elected to a
fellowship on taking his degree. Till his fortieth year he continued in
these academic shades, and would have remained there peacefully enough
to his life’s end if an accident had not brought him under the notice
of Henry VIII.

Colet and others, some years earlier, had introduced the new criticism
into Oxford; while Cranmer was an undergraduate, Cambridge was still
lagging behind. In 1511, however, the placid, not to say stagnant,
waters were moved by the appointment of Erasmus to the Greek Chair.
There is no record of any personal intercourse between Cranmer and
the great scholar; but it was precisely at this time that the former
withdrew his attention from the scholastic philosophy and theology
which had hitherto absorbed him, and devoted himself to studying the
Scriptures. In the University he seems to have been regarded as an
undoubtedly learned scholar; for Wolsey, who as an educationist chose
his men with judgment, offered him a canonry at his new “Cardinal
College” at Oxford; but he was not looked upon as one who would seek
preferment or be selected for it unsought, or as in any sense an
intellectual leader. The only incident worth noting is that at the
outset, being still a layman, he lost his fellowship by marrying
a respectable young “gentlewoman,” a connexion of the landlord of
a Cambridge hostelry. On her death, however, a year later, he was
re-elected to his fellowship--apparently a unique instance in those
times of such recognition--proceeding afterwards to take Holy Orders.

Now, in those early days, the intelligence and ability, not only of
laymen, but of the greatest ecclesiastics were all on the side of the
intellectual emancipation of which Erasmus was the apostle. Archbishop
Warham was the scholar’s patron, Fox of Winchester was his warm
admirer, Fisher of Rochester had given him his Cambridge appointment.
From his disciples Wolsey chose the men for the great college which
was his favourite scheme outside of pure politics. Colet, Dean of St.
Paul’s, and Thomas More, were among his closest friends. No one of any
account thought of receiving with anything but the warmest welcome his
edition of the Greek Testament and the _Utopia_ of More, which appeared
about the same time. Then a somewhat startling event occurred. The Pope
wanted money; he sent out commissioners to obtain it by the sale of
indulgences; and a monk at Wittenberg rose up and publicly denounced
the whole scheme. At first, the meaning of the portent was not fully
appreciated; but before long the denunciation of indulgences developed
into a challenge of the entire Papal system, of the pretensions of the
Popes, and of sundry accepted dogmas. Reformation by the influence of
sweetness and light was by no means the same thing as this volcanic
revolution. The men who had done so much to make the new movement
possible became eager to repress it. The English king plunged into
theological controversy, triumphantly vindicating the Papacy and
pulverising the monk of Wittenberg.

Before many years had passed, however, Henry found reason to modify
his views, as More had warned him he might do. Papal pretensions
stood in the way of royal designs, and that fact brought it home to
him that those pretensions were not based upon a rock. The Bishop of
Rome was also a European potentate subject to political pressure from
other potentates--a political factor with a spiritual sanction. If the
spiritual sanction were challenged, the political situation would be
simplified. The king’s authority in his own dominions would no longer
be trammeled by the claims of a foreign authority to over-ride it. When
a collision between the royal and the Papal authority became imminent,
it was time to be rid of the Papacy for good and all. That, of course,
was quite a different thing from admitting heretical dogmas or denials
of dogma.

The occasion was the divorce[C] of Katharine of Aragon. If the Pope
had been amenable in that matter, Henry would in all likelihood have
left the Papal authority where he found it. But Clement, terrorised
by the Emperor, was not amenable--despite the efforts of Wolsey. The
collapse of the legatine trial ruined Wolsey and decided the king on a
campaign with the object of establishing the Crown as the sole head of
the Spirituality; involving the withdrawal or repudiation of the Papal
claims and the formal subjection of the clergy in England.

      [C] This customary term for the proceedings has been used
          throughout. But it may be necessary to note that a
          “decree of nullity”--the thing sought--is not properly
          speaking a “divorce” at all. Nullity means that no
          marriage had in fact been contracted; divorce, that a
          marriage which had been contracted is dissolved.

The trial had just collapsed. Henry in dudgeon retired to Waltham.
Two of his suite, his almoner Fox and his secretary Stephen Gardiner,
took up their quarters with a Mr. Cressy, in whose house Dr. Cranmer
happened to be residing, as the son’s tutor. Gardiner and Fox, being
also respectively Provost and Master of King’s and Trinity Hall, were
acquainted with Cranmer; and together they naturally discussed what was
known as “the king’s affair.” In the course of conversation Cranmer
expressed himself to the effect that Henry could do without the Papal
decision. He could obtain from the universities of Europe the opinion
of the qualified divines on the question whether a Papal dispensation
for a marriage with a deceased brother’s widow was _ultra vires_; and
take corresponding action on his own responsibility when he learnt the
result. The English courts, in short, were competent to pronounce the
marriage null or valid, but the position would be made impregnable if
they had the expert opinion of Europe to go upon. The conversation was
reported to Henry, who caught at the scheme and summoned its deviser to
talk to him. Their interview terminated Cranmer’s hitherto undisturbed
prospect of passing his days in peaceful and learned seclusion; such
an instrument as this was not to be wasted. Unscrupulous loyalty
Henry knew by experience he could command; servants of the type which
provided it could be used till the last ounce of service had been
extracted from them, and then cast aside. But Henry wanted a man of
undeniable learning, unblemished character, a tender conscience, a
convenient theory of Church and State, and a certain impressibility.
The combination was not easily found--but he had found it.


III

RISE TO THE ARCHBISHOPRIC

The common animosity towards Cranmer of those who hold “high” doctrines
on the function of the priesthood is entirely intelligible. For them,
the divine revelation is entrusted to the Church, and the voice of
the Church is the voice of her priesthood. Its authority is absolute,
and secular powers seeking to control it are laying profane hands on
the Ark of the Covenant. That laymen should not humbly recognise that
august claim is deplorable; still, for laymen some excuse may be found.
But that a priest should not merely disavow it in words, but emphasise
the disavowal by his acts, aiding and abetting the desecration as
well as justifying it, is intolerable. When, moreover, that priest is
himself, as it were, the shepherd of the whole flock, whose position
demands that he above all others should be the guardian and champion of
the Church’s rights, he becomes a double-dyed traitor. Palpably guilty
of so heinous a crime, the presumption in favour of the truth of any
minor charges against him is so strong that it is hardly necessary to
examine them: they may almost be taken for granted.

If, indeed, it be unpardonable to believe that the State is supreme,
there can be no pardon for Cranmer. But if once it be admitted that a
man is not of necessity a moral reprobate for holding that view, and
that it is possible, even for a priest, to maintain it with entire
honesty and sincerity, the whole fabric of Cranmer’s condemnation
collapses. To Cranmer, the State meant the king, and in the king he
found an authority more divine--more definitely, that is, of divine
sanction--than in any other of the powers that be. When in Queen Mary’s
reign he found the royal authority in flat opposition to what he held
to be truth, no doubt a very painful and puzzling dilemma presented
itself; but the same dilemma is presented to every individual who,
having recognised some external authority as final, suddenly discovers
that the dictates of that authority and those of his own conscience are
in flat contradiction.

Cranmer, in short, was as complete and convinced an Erastian as any
layman could possibly have been. It was the clear perception of that
fact which primarily made Henry select him as Archbishop Warham’s
successor. A frankly Erastian archbishop was an anomaly, but it is not
necessary _ipso facto_ to condemn him as a criminal and a hypocrite, or
even as a time-server.

Cranmer, like a good many other people, was thoroughly convinced that,
though the marriage with Katharine had been effected in perfect good
faith, it was invalid in the nature of things, and could not be made
valid by any sort of ecclesiastical sanction, Papal or other. The king
set him to work to formulate a plea for nullity, and placed him under
the immediate influence of the Boleyn household, where the simple man
very readily learnt to form the highest opinion of the lady whom the
king had determined to make a queen. Then he was sent with Anne’s
father on a futile embassy to Bologna; and not long after his return
he was again despatched as an enemy to Germany, where he made many
friends but did not succeed in gaining many converts to his view on the
divorce question. There also he took the extremely uncanonical step of
marrying; but it must be remembered that while such marriages among the
secular clergy were not recognised by the law, they were not regarded
as offences against morality, and were by no means infrequent; while
in Germany itself they had become, or were becoming, the rule rather
than the exception. Cranmer was still in Germany when he received the
unexpected and most unwelcome summons to return to England and take
upon himself the ungrateful honour of the archbishopric.

In the meantime Henry’s “Reformation” parliament had been at work;
the campaign against the Pope and the clerical organisation was in
full swing: and Convocation, under the aged Warham, had been compelled
to affirm the royal supremacy. The “submission of the clergy” had
become an accomplished fact in Cranmer’s absence, and before he held
any position of high authority. The most stubborn of the bishops were
unable to resist the pressure of the Crown. They bowed to the logic
of facts, under protest and against their convictions, without being
condemned as subservient. Cranmer is called subservient mainly because
his convictions were on the king’s side.

It was always more agreeable to Henry to employ on any job he had
in hand men to whom that particular job was not distasteful. Thus,
knowing Sir Thomas More’s sentiments as to the divorce, he had given
the new Chancellor no business in connexion with it. It is not likely
that any of the bishops at this time, with the exception of Fisher,
would have felt strongly as to a breach with Rome--Gardiner and
Stokesly were both advocates of the divorce. But it was more convenient
to have an archbishop as to whose sentiments there was no manner of
doubt. It is not impossible that Gardiner, not Cranmer, would have
been chosen, if his attitude in regard to the “Supplication against
the Ordinaries” and the “Submission” of Convocation had not made Henry
scent in him a possible Becket. The Bishop of Winchester’s services had
been of considerable value; and if Cranmer’s appointment stirred his
jealousy, he can hardly be blamed. But it is scarcely to be doubted
that a personal antagonism to the rival, for whose first preferment
to Henry’s notice he had himself been in part responsible and by whom
he now found himself superseded, exercised a marked influence on
Gardiner’s attitude from this time.

Cranmer, summoned home, delayed on the way as much as he dared--in the
hope, it is said, that the king might be persuaded to change his mind
and make another selection. However, he arrived in January; Henry--for
his own ends--put pressure on the Pope to hasten the necessary bulls,
and the new Archbishop was consecrated on March 30 (1533). An oath of
obedience to the Pope was a necessary part of the ceremony. Such oaths
are commonly regarded as mere formalities, binding precisely so long
as it is convenient to recognise them. Cranmer, however, being very
well aware that whosoever became archbishop would very soon find it
necessary to ignore the oath or else to defy the king, was at pains to
announce beforehand that he only intended to respect the oath so far
as it consorted with obedience to the king--a declaration which has
been rather oddly condemned as hypocritical. Oaths and promises[D] made
purely _pro forma_ are a not very excusable institution, but the open
profession that they are made _pro forma_ only makes such hypocrisy as
is involved less, not greater.

      [D] How many godparents or brides, for instance, regard
          the formal promises they make in the face of the
          congregation as imposing a real and literal obligation?


IV

HENRY’S PRIMATE

The first business before Cranmer was to finish off the affair of
the divorce. Henry had already--whether in the previous November or
January--been privately married to Anne Boleyn. On the theory that
the marriage with Katharine was void _ab initio_, there was never any
bar to another marriage, though it was hardly possible to announce
one until the nullity had been formally declared: so that any further
delay was certain to cause a public scandal--since it was now April,
and Elizabeth was born in the following September. Convocation had
already pronounced in favour of Henry’s view; and if Cranmer was
somewhat anxious to evade possible obstructions, it was only because
the decision of the court was by this time a foregone conclusion.

For the destruction of More and Fisher (1534-1535) Cranmer was in
no sort of way responsible. He was on the Commission which had to
administer the Oath of Supremacy, which the two recalcitrants declined,
but it was not he who prescribed the form of the oath, nor had he
anything to say to the penalties. All he did do was to urge the king to
accept as sufficient a form of the oath to which Fisher and More were
both prepared to subscribe.

Something more is usually made of the Archbishop’s conduct at the
time of Anne Boleyn’s fall, as an instance of the subserviency which
is imputed to him. It is argued that officially at Henry’s bidding
he condemned the unhappy lady, while personally convinced of her
innocence. The whole story is enveloped in an obscurity which makes
that impression a natural one; nevertheless, the most probable
explanation of the circumstances is one which fairly exonerates the
Archbishop.

Henry had sought to have the nullity of the marriage with Katharine
established ostensibly for two main reasons. The first was the fruit of
conscience, that the union, though sanctioned by the Pope, was against
the moral law. The second was a reason of State, that a male heir to
the throne with an indisputable title was a necessity, and therefore
the king must be provided with another wife than Katharine. The other
wife he had chosen was Anne Boleyn, but she had failed to do what was
expected of her. Like her predecessor, she had borne a daughter, and
had two miscarriages Henry was tired of her, and was attracted to
another lady whose virtue was impregnable; therefore he wanted to be
rid of her in turn. Charges of treason on the ground of post-nuptial
immorality were brought against her, and on these she was condemned by
a court of peers composed in great part of those who would have been
readiest to welcome her acquittal. Here, we have nothing to do with
the truth or falsehood of the allegations; Cranmer was not one of the
judges, and had nothing whatever to do with the trial. But Anne had
from the first shown him the best side of her character, and he had a
perfect conviction that she was a good woman. He could not influence
the court; he had nothing which could be called evidence in her favour
to bring forward. The king’s wishes were obvious. Yet Cranmer took the
somewhat bold step of addressing the king, pleading earnestly and even
passionately on her behalf--though vainly.

But, for reasons best known to himself, Henry was not satisfied with a
condemnation for treason: he also required a divorce--or, to express
it more correctly, a declaration that the marriage, like that with
Katharine, had been void from the beginning. How could Cranmer, who
had officially declared it valid, now make any such pronouncement?
The answer is, that the technical ground on which it was voided had
not previously been taken into account. The story of a pre-contract
with Northumberland need not count for much, though for the avoidance
of scandal it was put in the forefront. The charges on which Anne was
condemned to death, while effective for proper divorce proceedings,
were irrelevant to the question of nullity. The real ground was that at
an earlier stage Henry had illicit relations with Anne’s elder sister,
Mary, thereby technically creating affinity with Anne, and rendering
the marriage with her void by canon law. How far Cranmer knew or
suspected this unofficially, when he declared the marriage valid, is
a matter of doubt--which is not set at rest by his pamphlet in favour
of the divorce. But, being now officially informed of it, he could not
maintain the technical validity of the marriage any longer. His view
of the importance of merely canonical prohibitions is illustrated by
his own uncanonical marriage. Even if he knew of the “affinity” he
would probably have accounted it no moral bar to a union. But, knowing
it, he could not deny that it made the marriage technically invalid.
It is, perhaps, worth noting that his plea for Anne’s life contains
a reference to Henry’s own morals, which may very well have been a
reminder that it was the king’s sin, not Anne’s, which had placed her
in a false position. As for her actual guilt or innocence under the
other accusations, the Primate could not protest against the king or
the judges being persuaded by the evidence, but he could, and did,
declare that, not having the evidence before him, he could not bring
himself to believe that the charges were true: but that did not touch
the question of nullity. Whoever deserved blame over the affair,
Cranmer did not.

Some years later Thomas Cromwell was struck down by his master. His
government had been in many respects a reign of terror. The populace
had no affection for him; the nobles hated him: the new men, even
those he had made, feared him; the king’s wrath was kindled against
him. The downfall of Wolsey had not been more universally acceptable.
But there was one man who lifted up his voice to plead for the fallen
minister--Thomas Cranmer, the time-server. As in the case of Anne
Boleyn, it was impossible for him to take up the cudgels in defence
of the man who had been less dangerous, perhaps, to him than to most
others--dangerous he was to every one, for he spared neither friend
nor foe--but who else would have dared, or ever did dare, to appeal to
Henry in the day of his wrath?

It was not Cranmer who directed the course of the Reformation under
Henry. The breach with Rome in all its completeness was devised and
carried out without aid from him, unless the suggestion of taking the
opinion of the Universities on the divorce is to be counted as aid.
Before the king had ever heard of Cranmer, Gardiner had told Clement
in plain terms that if he refused to entertain the English king’s
wishes England would repudiate his jurisdiction altogether. The great
majority of the bishops were no friends to the Papal claims, though
some of them would have taken a different line if they had not been
too late in discovering that the king meant to impose his own yoke
instead of the Pope’s: and the same thing might be said of Convocation
generally. Gardiner and Stokesley, the most persistent of Cranmer’s
antagonists, had been foremost in supporting the king against the
Pope. The clergy had writhed and resisted when the attack was turned
against themselves by the “Supplication against the Ordinaries,” but
they had been forced to surrender and make their “Submission” while
Warham was still Archbishop and Cranmer was engaged in other matters.
Even after he became Primate Cranmer had no actual hand or voice in
the great despoiling measures which accompanied the dissolution of the
monasteries; while the downfall of the monastic system in itself was
probably not unwelcome to the bulk of the secular clergy, between whom
and the regulars there was constant friction and jealousy.

In this connexion, however, while Cranmer, like Gardiner and the rest,
neither aided nor hindered Cromwell’s work, it ought to stand to his
eternal credit that he was almost alone in protesting, not against the
spoliation itself--practically no one seems to have ventured to do
that--but against the misuse of the wealth which thus changed hands. He
wrote to Cromwell emphatically expressing his grief and disappointment
that those funds were not appropriated to education--still accounted
one of the primary functions of the Church. Had the course which he
urged been followed there would have been little possibility of saying
that the Church was robbed. But Cromwell and his master had other
uses for the spoils. It is remarkable, too, that when educational
establishments were endowed Cranmer made a vigorous stand on behalf of
humble scholars against those who would have confined their benefits to
the sons of the well-to-do.

So far, however, as concerned matters of doctrine and practice the
Archbishop exercised some influence. His sojourn in Germany had not
made him a Lutheran, but it had inclined him to give favourable
consideration to the opinions of sober reformers on the Continent.
Viewing the Papacy as the enemy, he was always sanguine of the
possibility that a common standard of doctrine might be formulated in
consultation with the Protestant leaders; and such an agreement was a
pet project of his, the theological counterpart of Cromwell’s political
league with the Lutherans. Henry, however, looked askance on both
schemes, and the Archbishop’s efforts were doomed to disappointment.

Anxious as Cranmer was for a union of the opponents of Papacy,
there were many disputable points on which his own judgment had not
crystallised. In the matter, however, on which he really laid most
stress he got his way. An English Bible which all men might read was
the desire of his heart, and that was the one innovation of first-rate
importance to which Henry acceded. The first Convocation over which he
presided petitioned for a commission to prepare such a volume, and the
petition was granted. The Commission itself was ineffective enough;
some of the members, like Stokesley, desired only to obstruct the
work as far as in them lay. But the principle was conceded, and the
Commission was made superfluous by the appearance of Coverdale’s and
“Matthew’s” versions. There is no doubt at all that the main credit is
due to Cranmer, though his efforts would have been vain enough without
the powerful support of Cromwell. A kindred concession to Cranmer’s
enthusiasm for the English language was the authorisation, in Henry’s
later years, of an English Litany.

When John Frith affirmed the proposition that a correct belief on the
subject of the Eucharist could not be essential to salvation, there
were few, if any, of his contemporaries who did not regard him as
an anarchist in religion. But the subject of the Eucharist was only
one among many as to which men were in a state of great uncertainty
concerning the belief which should be regarded as correct. A standard
was wanted; it might be rigid, or it might be elastic. Given a standard
fixed by authority, no one was prepared as yet to admit that the
individual was at liberty to set up a different standard for himself:
no one doubted that the lack of an authoritative standard was an
evil. Hence arose the efforts in Henry’s reign to evolve acceptable
formularies, which should define what must be acknowledged as true
doctrines.

In the devising of these Cranmer, as well as many others, had his
share. They did not express the views of any one man--unless it were
the king--or any one party. They were three in number: first, the “Ten
Articles” for “establishing Christian quietness”; then the “Institution
of a Christian Man,” commonly called the _Bishop’s Book_; and some
years later the “Necessary Doctrine and Erudition of a Christian Man,”
known as the _King’s Book_. Between the first and the last there is no
definite change of doctrinal attitude. None of the three breaks away
from received opinion; they differ mainly in the precision with which
certain points are insisted upon. Thus, in the first, the doctrine
of the Real Presence is affirmed, but not explicitly in the form of
Transubstantiation. The movement is rather towards rigidity. Cranmer
and some of his colleagues made tentative suggestions in favour of
admitting more advanced views, which were not approved, and in the case
of the King’s Book, it is clear that the opposing party hoped to get
something of a much more decisively reactionary character.

Cranmer was a long way from being an Anselm, a Becket, or a Langton.
But on the whole, taking together the history of those three
formularies, and adding that of the Six Articles Act, which intervened,
the surprising thing about him is not his subserviency, but the
persistency with which he defended his own views. The “Whip with Six
Strings” was a tightening of the bonds which came upon the advanced
party with a startling shock. Cranmer fought the Bill in Parliament,
and he fought some of its positions in convocation after the king’s
mind was very well known. By the king’s desire, he put his argument
down in black-and-white for the royal perusal after the Act had become
law--a manifestly dangerous step. When the “King’s Book” was in hand,
he again fought, though unsuccessfully, for the admission of views
which the Act condemned; and he told Henry with perfect candour that,
although he obeyed the law as in duty bound, his opinion remained
unaltered. Throughout all the discussions he criticised the royal
suggestions and comments with an admirable frankness which none of his
colleagues ventured to display.

The curious thing is that Cranmer was the one man who could say what he
would to the king without arousing his anger, as Cromwell remarked to
him with not unkindly envy: but he could not deflect the monarch from
the path he chose by a single hair’s breadth. Twice after Cromwell’s
fall the reactionaries fancied that they had the Archbishop fairly
in the toils; both times they were brought up with a round turn by
their master and his. The combination of ruthless force with great
intellectual power in both Cromwell and Henry found by contrast a
strange attraction in the Primate’s guilelessness. “Oh, Lord God,”
exclaimed Henry on one occasion, “what fond simplicity have you, so
to permit yourself to be imprisoned that every enemy of yours may
take vantage against you.” They both chose to protect him against
the enemies who certainly were not guileless; and bestowed on him
an affection which was half-admiring and half-pitying; an affection
returned by that which is often felt by a tender and pliant nature for
a rugged and imperious one. When Cranmer felt impelled to remonstrate
with their proceedings, he did so with trepidation; they ignored the
remonstrances, but liked him none the worse. It might be said that he
was the only man or woman of whom, being brought in frequent contact,
Henry never fell foul. There was always warm respect in Henry’s
fondness for him; and Henry was by no means the man to feel respect for
a time-server.


V

CRANMER AND SOMERSET

The death of Henry was the beginning of a new era. Hitherto his
personality had completely dominated the situation; effectively, he had
become the most uncontrolled autocrat in Europe, in spite of a very
careful preservation of traditional forms. But his successor on the
throne was a nine-year-old boy, and there was no dominating personality
to take the dead king’s place. If Henry’s scheme for the continuation
of the government had been framed with a view to the maintenance of the
_status quo_, it was a very complete failure.

Superficially, that would seem to have been the idea. The Council
of Executors in whom power was vested by Henry’s will was a body in
which the progressive and stationary or reactionary parties were both
represented. The strength of the latter, however, suffered serious
detriment in the closing weeks of Henry’s reign by the downfall of the
Howards: while their ecclesiastical leader, Gardiner, was excluded from
the Council, on which their principal representative among Churchmen
was Tunstal of Durham, a man as mild as Cranmer himself. Within a
week, the Earl of Hertford, now become Duke of Somerset, had secured
the Protectorate in his own hands, and it became immediately and
abundantly clear that the whole effective power was in the hands of the
progressive party.

Now at this stage there were not many points of doctrine on which
the leaders of the progressive party were committed to opinions
fundamentally opposed to those received. Cranmer’s chief allies had not
openly rejected even the doctrine of Transubstantiation, and certainly
did not dispute the Real Presence: but they definitely favoured the
administration of the cup to the laity; they held that it was lawful
for priests to marry; and that auricular confession was not enjoined by
Scripture. Cranmer had defended each of these views at the time of the
Six Articles and of the King’s Book. They had been unsatisfied by the
removal of “abused images” in the last reign, and desired an extension
thereof. Cranmer’s own exposition of what he considered orthodox
doctrine was contained in the Book of Homilies which he had prepared
but had failed to persuade Henry to authorise: while the idea of a new
uniform Book of Services had long been familiar and vaguely in favour.
The men of the “Old Learning” did not fear the specific innovations
as particularly dangerous _per se_; what they did fear was that the
innovators would go a great deal further.

We remark, then, first, that under the _régime_ of Somerset, the
changes in religion were almost precisely what the Archbishop had
advocated under Henry VIII. The Homilies were authorised; the
destruction of “abused images” was renewed; the administration of
the cup to the laity in the sacrament was enjoined, and the marriage
of priests permitted--both on the petition of convocation; and the
promulgation of a new Order of Service was almost of necessity
attended by an “Act of Uniformity” compelling the clergy to adopt it.
Equally as a matter of course, the Six Articles Act, against which
Cranmer had fought at the outset, was repealed. The present writer has
in the past been severely rebuked for attributing the form the Reformed
Church in England took to Cranmer more than to any other single man.
“He ought to know,” said the critics, “that Somerset was the man.”
Yet repentance lags. Somerset was the politician who, up to a certain
point, carried the Reformation through: at that point his influence
on it ceased abruptly, and the business passed into Warwick’s hands.
The point where this change took place coincided accurately with the
completion of the series of reforms of which the Archbishop had for
some years past avowedly been in favour. The inference that Somerset
was guided by Cranmer is sufficiently obvious, though no doubt the hand
was the Protector’s hand. The further advance after Somerset’s fall was
mainly, or largely, the work of men of extreme views, whose zeal the
Archbishop succeeded, to some extent, in restraining; his influence was
still at work--no longer, however, as that of the artificer, but as
that of the moderator.

Apparently, Cranmer and the Protector worked in complete harmony,
save in the one matter of the chantries; but there is no sign at all
that he took his cue from the Protector. The principles of Somerset’s
reformation were his. Those principles, moreover, do not appear to have
gone beyond what the most anti-Protestant of modern Anglicans accept.
The statutory changes, however, were accompanied by proceedings of a
regrettable character. In the attack on images, individuals were guilty
of violence and irreverence, not to say sacrilege. Extravagant and
inflammatory language was used in the pulpits. The treatment of the
leaders of the Opposition was not altogether free from vindictiveness.
For the first group, Cranmer was in no way responsible; Somerset was,
because in some respects he set a bad example himself. For the second,
the two were jointly responsible, since preaching was restricted to
licensed persons, and the licences were issued only by the Protector
and the Archbishop. For the third, Somerset was guiltless. The attacks
on Gardiner and Bonner were made in his absence and supported by his
colleague. But the mildest of men do not often view opportunities of
retaliation with entire indifference. Gardiner had certainly done
his best to ruin Cranmer under Henry; and by comparison at least the
measures taken against him were mild enough.

Some consideration, however, must be given to the argument that the
Protector’s government forced Protestantism hastily and prematurely
on a reluctant nation. Whether the religion formulated in the first
Prayer Book of Edward VI. can be legitimately called Protestantism
at all may be left to the controversialists; but there is no manner
of doubt that the methods attending the introduction of the Service
Book were ill-judged and vexatious. On the other hand, the evidence
that there was any strong opposition to the change itself lies mainly
in the fact that the Western rising which immediately followed was
professedly directed against it. Nevertheless, the mere fact that there
was an almost simultaneous rising in the Eastern counties, which beyond
all question was exclusively agrarian in character, suggests forcibly
that the real moving force of the Western revolt also was agrarian.
Ket’s supporters, significantly enough, held daily services, using the
new Service Book: while one of the demands of the Cornishmen was for
the restoration of the monastic lands--that is, of the monasteries as
landlords in place of their rapacious supplanters. Clerical agitators
would have found little difficulty in making the Westland rustics
believe that half their troubles were due to the attacks on the Church
in the past reign; and the identification of greedy landlords with the
cause of ecclesiastical reform was at the worst colourable. Cranmer
might condemn and Latimer might lash the landlords from the pulpit,
Somerset might set up his Court of Requests; these things did not reach
the remote districts. But there, men did see the spoilers of the Church
enclosing commons, changing tillage into sheep-runs, and evicting small
tenants. And they drew their conclusions. The Reformation would have
had to wait half a century if it had been delayed till that argument
was deprived of all force. But it may certainly be granted that the
changes which preceded Somerset’s fall went quite as far as the country
at large was prepared for.

It is rather curious to observe that Cranmer fairly lost his temper
over the Cornish rebellion, and scolded the insurgents somewhat after
the model set by Henry VIII. when he rated the Lincolnshire men a
dozen years earlier.


VI

THE FLOWING TIDE OF PROTESTANTISM

Cranmer had no hand at all in the intrigue which overthrew the
Protector. For a brief interval there was even some uncertainty whether
the group who had captured the Government might not make terms with the
Opposition, release Gardiner, and possibly take him into partnership.
If Warwick ever had such an idea in his mind, he was far too acute to
entertain it for long. Gardiner as a colleague would have been a very
dangerous rival. The alternative was to assume the lead of the advanced
wing of the progressive party. Warwick, who died professing himself a
devout Catholic, had no difficulty in assimilating the jargon of the
zealots, and convincing their honest enthusiasm that they might look
upon him as a Joshua, while he doubled the part with that of Achan.
To him, religion was not among the things that mattered; but religion
might be made to serve its turn in forwarding his own ambitions.

Hitherto the Reformation in England had moved a good deal more
closely along the lines laid down a hundred and fifty years before
by Wiclif than on those of Luther or of Calvin; approximating more
nearly to the Zurich school, though by no means identical with them.
Zurich had proved more attractive to English refugees also. But now
the abolition of the penal laws in England, and the dissatisfaction
caused by the Augsburg Interim in Germany, brought into the country
a number of foreigners, Lutheran and Calvinist as well as Zwinglian,
including on the one hand Bucer and on the other John Knox--besides
returning English refugees. Not a few of these foreign visitors were
inspired with a lively missionary zeal, and the freedom of discussion
permitted naturally caused debate and controversy to wax fast and
furious. If the country in general found the concessions already made
to the new learning somewhat larger than was quite to its taste,
the followers of the new learning were very far from satisfied with
them. And they were vocal exceedingly, if not precisely harmonious.
It was very soon evident that the comprehensive ambiguity of the new
Book of Common Prayer was in the eyes of the Reformers too liberal
to the old Catholics and not sufficiently advanced for the new
Protestants--controversy raging chiefly over two subjects, the first
being the Eucharist, and the second Forms and Ceremonies.

Without attempting to examine the actual views on the former subject
held at this time by Cranmer--as to which critics appear able to form
very positive but very contradictory conclusions--it may be quite
safely asserted that he had quite definitely given up all belief in
Transubstantiation, but had not accepted the view most remote from
it, that the service was purely commemorative. The varied range of
intermediate views might be associated with either of these in a
common Form of Service, but these extremes were evidently incompatible.
One or other must be excluded. Cranmer, his right-hand man Ridley, and
their associates, were all travelling towards the Zwinglian position,
whether they ultimately reached it or not. If there was to be any more
defining, it was the followers of the old learning who would be shut
out thereby.

It was much the same with forms and ceremonies. The extreme men,
whether they looked to Zurich or Geneva for guidance, regarded nearly
everything in the way of vestments and ceremonial as the trappings
of the Scarlet Woman. The Archbishop did not. Where these things
did not directly imply the truth of specific doctrines definitely
discarded--the sacrifice of the Mass, the worship of images, and the
like--their preservation, in his view, tended to decency and reverence.
Here, again, it was evident that any changes must tend to the exclusion
of the rigid Catholics. They and the Calvinists could not travel in the
same boat.

The result is to be seen in the second Prayer Book of Edward VI.,
in the new Ordinal, and in the Forty-two Articles which, with
slight modification, became the Thirty-nine of Queen Elizabeth.
Warwick--otherwise Northumberland--was with the extremists, who were
vigorous and loud-voiced, and altogether exercised an amount of
forcing-power quite disproportionate to the number of their adherents
among the general public. If they had had their way, the re-modelling
would have been on lines satisfactory to John Knox. Northumberland’s
government would not have stood in the way. The Lutheranism of Germany
and the Augsburg Confession was uncongenial. It was Cranmer, Ridley,
and their adherents who succeeded in retaining for the Church of
England a form to which she could mould herself, after the Marian
_régime_, without returning to the Roman obedience or adopting the
Scottish model. If that was a praiseworthy achievement, it is to
Cranmer primarily that the praise is rightfully due.

That is what Cranmer did. From Somerset’s record, it may reasonably be
inferred that it is very much what he would have endeavoured to do if
he had remained in power. But he did not have the opportunity, because
he was not in power, and Warwick cut his head off.

What Cranmer would have liked to do, beyond what he did, is another
matter, and may be gathered from his proposed _Reformatio Legum
Ecclesiasticarum_--a document which shows that, Erastian though he
was, he desired the clergy to have much ampler powers of jurisdiction
than there was the faintest chance of the State delegating to them.
It was an essay in constitution-making of a decidedly academic order:
the machinery would never have worked. It does not reveal unsuspected
qualities of constructive statesmanship; but it does not detract from
the credit due to the manner in which the Archbishop managed to steer
the ship through very stormy waters with a mutinous crew on board.
The performance was not, perhaps, masterly; but it is not extravagant
praise to call it meritorious.


VII

DE PROFUNDIS

Northumberland’s methods did not make him popular; but they made
him powerful, and it was his primary object to place on the throne
in succession to Edward some one who should be his own puppet. To
this end he devoted himself in the last months of the young king’s
life. By Henry VIII.’s will, the succession was fixed first on Mary,
then on Elizabeth, then on the Greys--not Suffolk himself, but his
wife Frances Brandon and their children. The accession of Mary could
only mean destruction for Northumberland. He could not be sure of
Elizabeth, who was now in her twentieth year. But he thought he
could make quite sure of Lady Jane Grey, who was hardly more than a
child and had been brought up under pronounced Protestant tutelage.
His plan was to marry her to one of his own sons, induce Edward to
assume the authority formally granted to his father and name her his
heir--ostensibly, of course, on the ground that both his sisters
had been declared illegitimate and those judgments had not been
revoked--and trust to intrigue and force to secure her on the throne.
Having won the king over, he succeeded in entangling several of the
Council in the conspiracy; the rest were then worked upon individually
to give their adherence. One after another did so, reluctantly, till
all were drawn in save Hales--Cranmer being the last, and assenting
only on the positive assurance that the Crown lawyers had guaranteed
the constitutional validity of the instrument he was called upon to
sign, and under direct personal pressure from the king. Northumberland,
however, had completely miscalculated the forces at work. He knew that
the very signatories of the document could not be relied on when out
of his reach; but having them under his grip, he thought himself safe.
But the country rallied to Mary; the troops deserted to her standard;
the plot failed, ignominiously and utterly. Mary was hailed Queen; the
arch-traitor was sent to the block; for the rest, only a few of those
most conspicuously compromised were sent to the Tower.

It was, of course, obvious at the outset that Mary’s rule must mean
the return to power of the party which had been in opposition under
Somerset and more actively repressed under his successor. The daughter
of Katharine of Aragon was a convinced adherent of the entire Roman
position. That she would go so far as to restore the Roman obedience
might have been a matter of doubt; but, short of that, she was not
likely to allow limits to reaction. Gardiner and Bonner, Tunstal and
Day and Heath, had all been imprisoned and deprived of their sees
during the last four years; it was not likely that the advanced bishops
would be allowed to retain their functions. And, beyond theological
differences, some of them had been driven by the religious motive into
open and vigorous support of Lady Jane Grey’s succession. Of Cranmer
himself the most that could be said was that he was an assenting party;
but Ridley, Bishop of London, had committed himself to the cause in
somewhat inflammatory language.

Nevertheless, Mary was in no haste to strike. Every one who feared
for his own skin was given time and opportunity to retire from the
country--whereof not a few made haste to take advantage. Ridley was
arrested; but Cranmer, Latimer, and others who stood their ground
manfully, might have gone if they would. After all, no Catholics
during the last reign had suffered anything worse than imprisonment,
and Mary’s leniency towards the participators in the rebellion may
well have given an impression that retaliation would not go beyond the
infliction of corresponding penalties.

Cranmer, then, remained at large for a time. But a report was
circulated that he was about to make submission, and had himself set
up the Mass again. Had it not been for this, he might have hoped to
be allowed to retire into obscurity; but the rumour stirred him to an
indignant and uncompromising denial, which was promptly followed by
his arrest for complicity in Northumberland’s plot. The Archbishop
was by nature a sanguine man, but he can hardly have imagined that
this protest of his would be allowed to pass; for it was practically
a challenge to all and sundry who desired the Mass to be restored. No
government of the time would have dreamed of ignoring the action of its
author.

Even when he was safely in the Tower along with Ridley, the hopefulness
of Cranmer’s temperament displayed itself. He had an incurable
conviction that any one who listened to him was bound to recognise the
entire reasonableness of his views; and from prison he petitioned Mary
for leave to “open his mind” to her. That accomplished, he felt that
he would have discharged his conscience and could retire from further
controversy without reproach, even though he might fail to persuade
his sovereign. The duty of conformity, in conduct at least, to the
sovereign’s decrees, was, as already remarked, a cardinal belief with
him.

The petition was not granted. Moreover, the reign of clemency was
destined to very brief duration. Wyatt’s rebellion hardened the Queen,
whose determination to marry Philip of Spain strengthened _pari passu_
with her determination to be reconciled with Rome and to discharge her
duty as a daughter of the Church by bringing her subjects back to the
fold. Throughout 1554 signs accumulated, ominous of the coming storm.
Whatever Mary’s original intent may have been, mercy to Cranmer must
have ceased to be a part of it at an early stage; though, if she had
definitely resolved on his destruction, it is difficult to find an
adequate explanation of the extreme prolongation of his imprisonment.

In April 1554, the three who were most obnoxious to Mary and the
reactionaries, Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, were removed to Oxford,
to play their part in a great disputation. All three held their
ground stoutly. It was pronounced, of course, that all three had been
completely refuted, and were manifest heretics; but being thereupon
invited to recant, they all refused. Cranmer had been treated with
considerable rudeness in the course of the debates; but the mildness
and dignity of his bearing throughout were such that one of his chief
antagonists, the Prolocutor, Dean Weston, thanked him openly for his
admirable behaviour.

This condemnation, however, was of no practical account, since, in
1554, the penal laws against heresy were not yet re-enacted. On the
other hand, to punish Cranmer for treason would be a palpable piece of
pure vindictiveness. His treason, such as it was, had been shared by
several of the men who were now on the Council. But the arrival of Pole
and the formal reconciliation with Rome at the close of the year were
accompanied by the revival of the statute _de heretico comburendo_, and
the great persecution opened in February with the burning of Rogers.
A twelvemonth more passed before the end came for Cranmer himself. It
is perhaps, after all, a sufficient explanation of the delay that the
Primate of England could only be condemned for heresy by the Pope.
Other cases fell within the jurisdiction of the legatine or national
ecclesiastical courts; his did not.

In September 1555, a Papal Commission sat in Oxford to examine the case
of the Archbishop and report to Rome for the Pope to pass judgment.
Cranmer refused to recognise the jurisdiction, but made a declaration
in answer to the questions put to him as coming from the Queen’s
Proctors, who were on the Commission. He maintained his views on the
Sacrament, and on the Royal Supremacy, and on the usurpations of
Rome; and justified his actions on all points in respect of which it
had been impugned. The trial over, he followed up his defence by a
vigorous address to the Queen, asserting the utter incompatibility of
any sovereign authority with the Papal claims. On November 25 the Pope
pronounced his excommunication. In the meantime Ridley and Latimer had
been condemned by a court under the authority of the Legate, Cardinal
Pole, on October 1, and on the 16th they suffered martyrdom--Cranmer,
it is said, witnessing the scene from the roof of his prison.

Cranmer remained in prison, cut off from every sympathiser. It is easy
to forget, but it should not be difficult to realise, the tremendous
strain on a nature like his--sensitive, diffident, imaginative. All his
life he had been surrounded and supported by the personal affection
of friends. Now, every conceivable incentive to doubt whether he had
been in the right after all was set to work on him simultaneously. Yet
month followed month, and he remained steadfast--unless his expression
of a desire to confer with Tunstal or Pole was a sign of weakening.
Before he could be handed over to the secular arm, his ecclesiastical
degradation was necessary. The sentence was carried out with every
circumstance of public ignominy--Bonner, the principal performer,
excelling himself in his coarse brutality. For a man with highstrung
nerves, the thing must have been simply shattering.

At the ceremony (February 14) he had drawn from his sleeve an appeal
from the Pope to a general council; and about this time he signed
in close succession what are called four recantations. Two of them
probably preceded the degradation; the other two Bonner extracted from
him on February 15. None of them are recantations at all. They are
submissions to the authority of the sovereign, to whom he had always
taught that submission is due. He had obeyed his own conscience in
contravention of his own theory hitherto; now, he returned to the
theory, and owned that if the secular sovereign willed to establish
Papal authority, obedience was still due. As to doctrine he recanted
nothing. But this was not nearly enough for Mary and Pole, who were
bent on extracting something which should altogether discredit the
cause of the Reformation.

Within ten days the writ for his burning was issued. Then, before three
more weeks had passed Cranmer broke down under the strain, writing
first a full and complete recantation of every impugned doctrine, and
then one more--dictated to him (March 18). No man ever repudiated his
whole past in terms more ignominious. His enemies had what they wanted;
if they had stopped there and pardoned him, the force of the blow would
have been incalculable. But their thirst for his blood gave him the
chance of salvation, changing their victory to hopeless rout. They did
not pardon. They demanded from the victim the public confirmation from
his own lips of the recantations he had written and signed. That one
disastrous moment of weakness was to be gloriously redeemed.

Three days after his fall, on a morning of foul March weather, Cranmer
was conveyed from his prison to listen himself to his own funeral
discourse and then to play his own allotted part. No suspicion seems
to have crossed the mind of his gaolers that there was anything
for them to fear. The oration over--he had listened with frequent
tears--he was bidden to make public avowal of his recantation. He
arose; he confessed the grievousness of his sin, entreating pardon
before the Throne of Omnipotence. And then he declared the nature of
his sin. Before those about him could realise what was happening, he
had recanted his recantation, declaring the truth of all he had before
upheld, and proclaiming, “As my hand offended in writing contrary to
my heart, therefore my hand shall first be punished. For if I may come
to the fire, it shall first be burned.” Hastily he was silenced, and
hurried to the stake; but of his own will he moved so swiftly that the
confessors could scarce keep pace with him. And when, indeed, he “came
to the fire” he fulfilled his words. Men saw him thrust the offending
right hand into the flame, and hold it there till it was consumed.

       *       *       *       *       *

So tragically, so triumphantly, closed the drama of Cranmer’s
life--surely a close fitted for “purging the passions through pity and
fear.” A vase of fine porcelain whirled into the eddies in company with
pots of brass and stoneware; a scholar, dragged from academic cloisters
to control a revolution; a man with a receptive mind, when receptivity
was about as dangerous a quality, for himself, as he could possess.
A man whom men have ventured to call craven, yet who alone of his
contemporaries dared to remonstrate with Cromwell in his policy and
with the eighth Henry in the day of his wrath, and that not once, nor
twice. A man who endured till the eleventh hour, and then--fell.

But a man who, ere the twelfth hour had struck, rose up the Victor.




WILLIAM CECIL, LORD BURGHLEY


I

THE MINISTERS OF QUEEN ELIZABETH

William Cecil was born in 1520. He lived to the age of seventy-eight,
dying in the same year as Philip II. of Spain, who was five years his
junior. His political connexion began before Henry VIII. was in his
grave; and for more than fifty years it continued, except for his
retirement from the public eye during the complete period of the Marian
persecution. Even in his old age, when his son Robert was already
becoming, in his own crafty fashion, the most important person in
Queen Elizabeth’s Council, the father was still the adviser on whom
she leaned in the last resort. For forty years he was, in fact, the
mainstay of her Government. For twenty of those years--roughly from
1569 to 1589--a man of even higher ability, in some respects, than
himself, Francis Walsingham, was his loyal colleague. They served the
cleverest, the most successful, and the most exasperating princess
who ever sat upon a throne. Both of them--especially Walsingham--told
her home-truths on occasion; both of them--especially Walsingham--she
on occasion abused like a Billingsgate fish-wife. But all three were
unfailingly loyal to each other; and among them they raised England to
the forefront of the nations of Christendom.

[Illustration: _WILLIAM CECIL (LORD BURGHLEY)_

Gallery_]

To establish orderly government at home, to settle a religious _modus
vivendi_, to avoid war, and to prevent the succession of Mary Stewart
or any pronounced Catholic--these were the main aims on which Elizabeth
and her two great ministers were united. Of the three, Walsingham--a
Puritan--was the least devoted to the Peace policy, Elizabeth the
most determined on that policy; yet it was Elizabeth who habitually
endangered it. The Queen’s tortuous methods, pursued in defiance
of her counsellors, more than once seemed to have brought her to a
point where war was inevitable; yet time after time her ingenuity,
or her lucky star, or a return just in time to Cecil’s guidance,
saved the situation. Never has a sovereign been better served; never
has there been a reign in which rulers and ruled worked in more
essential concord. Idealism and common sense were united in the
conduct of affairs with a completeness which has rarely, if ever, been
paralleled--never have the toils of the men of counsel and the men
of action been more effectively combined. And England was peculiarly
fortunate in this--that the great antagonist whom finally she fought
and overthrew could be thoroughly relied on always to miss the
opportunity for which he was always waiting, always to move only when
the moment had passed irrevocably. So England was the victor in the
great duel; and the Stewarts found her might established on a basis so
firm that even they were unable to pull it down.

That result was not due to any one mind--to any single guide.
Elizabeth, her ministers, her seamen, and her people, all contributed
their share; and the work was crowned by the glory of her poets.
Burghley may not have been personally a statesman of the highest rank,
though if he is not included in that category it is a little difficult
to name any Englishman who is entitled to that honour. There is a
certain commonplace, _bourgeois_ touch about him; he stands for the
common sense, not the idealist, side, in the combination which made
England great. His virtues were those of the successful pursuers of the
_via media_. He did not organise revolution: he did not dream of an
empire on which the sun should never set. But he played the political
game with unfailing loyalty to his sovereign and his country, with
level-headed shrewdness, with imperturbable resolution. There are few
men to whom England owes so much; and if there be those to whom she
owes more, their deeds but for him would yet have been impossible.


II

CECIL UNDER EDWARD VI. AND MARY

In the reign of Henry VII., Richard Sitsilt, affirmed by tradition
to be of an ancient Welsh family long established among the gentry
of the Marches, owned broad acres in the counties of Monmouth and
Herefordshire. One of his sons, David, who elected to modify his name
into Cecil, transferred himself to Lincolnshire, where he prospered
greatly. He and his son Richard became very large landed proprietors,
and held a variety of offices connected with the Court under Henry
VIII. So it would appear that the present Marquess of Salisbury is not
unconnected by descent with the “Celtic fringe.” It must be admitted,
however, that the notable qualities of his great ancestor are not those
usually associated with what is supposed to be the Celtic temperament.
Still in that connexion a rather curious point may be touched on. A
critic has recently remarked that there is a type of statesmanship
which we are in the habit of regarding as peculiarly English (_à
propos_ of l’Hôpital), naming in a brief list both Burghley and
Cromwell--Oliver, apparently, not Thomas. Now Oliver was descended from
the sister of Thomas, whose husband was a Welshman, and whose son chose
to adopt the maternal patronymic instead of his father’s name, which
was Williams. So Wales has some title to claim the Tudors, the Cecils,
and the great Oliver among her contributions to “English” celebrities.

William Cecil was born in 1520, and when in due course he went to
Cambridge, he became a member of a distinguished group of scholars
which included Roger Ascham, afterwards tutor of Lady Jane Grey and
of Elizabeth; John Cheke, who became the tutor of Edward VI., and
whose sister was Cecil’s first wife; and Nicholas Bacon, who married
the sister of Cecil’s second wife. William Cecil married Mary Cheke
in 1541: she died in less than two years, after bearing him one son,
Thomas, afterwards Lord Exeter. Nearly three years later he married
Mildred, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, the “governor” of Prince
Edward--a young lady of portentous learning, whose name Roger Ascham
coupled with that of Jane Grey. Thus Cecil himself was not only well
versed in the most progressive learning of his time, but his chosen
associates, including both the first and the second wife, were all
distinguished for erudition--and all, it may be remarked, tinged with
the “New Learning” in the specific ecclesiastical sense of the term.

Before the death of Henry VIII. the young man was already the recipient
of Court favour, and in the good graces of the Earl of Hertford,
to whose personal service we find him definitely attached in the
early days of the Protectorship. He accompanied the Protector on his
Scottish invasion, was present at Pinkie, and was made Somerset’s
secretary about a year later. His assiduity and his immense capacity
for mastering laborious detail must have been of infinite value to his
chief, whose woeful lack of practicality must, on the other hand, have
intensified his secretary’s inborn tendency to rate common sense in
method a long way higher than visionary idealism of aim. All his life
long, nothing ever induced Cecil to deviate from safe precedent and
respectable courses--bold enough, when his foresight satisfied him that
boldness was the better part of prudence, but never rash. Every step
was always carefully calculated, and a path for retreat kept open if
there was the remotest risk of retreat being necessary. In the service
of the most impulsive and sentimental of statesmen, he learnt--if he
needed to learn--never to act upon sentiment or impulse.

When Somerset fell in 1549 Cecil was still some way short of thirty;
but he had an old head on his young shoulders--and he had every
intention of keeping it there. He had no personal devotion to Somerset
or to his policy, and had carefully avoided quarrelling with anybody.
When he perceived that the ship was scuttled, he had no compunction
about making sure of leaving it in a decent and orderly manner before
it sank. He did not quite desert; he remained with the Protector in the
discharge of his duties, while very nearly every one else was making a
parade of sympathy with the cabal who obviously held the winning cards;
but he remained there in careful obscurity--the personal secretary,
not the partisan. He did not escape a brief imprisonment in the Tower;
no doubt he had counted on that. But Warwick was perfectly aware of
his power of making himself useful, and saw no possible reason why he
should not avail himself thereof--nor did Cecil. Competent officials
were few, and of these some had already put themselves out of court,
in Warwick’s eyes, either by having supported Somerset too boldly or
by displaying doubtful religious leanings. The former secretary of
Somerset had not made himself obnoxious in any quarter; and in the
following September (1550) he emerged again into public life in a more
responsible position than before, as Secretary of State.

The political waters were, to say the least, unquiet; there was no
telling when squalls might be coming. Personal intrigues were rife.
Cecil had no ambition to grasp the tiller under these conditions. He
was ready to give advice to the best of his ability; he was ready to
carry out instructions, whether they accorded with his advice or not;
but he was not disposed to give orders on his own account--his ambition
was not of the vaulting sort. His business was to keep his own footing,
whether others did so or no; he would take no risks unless his own
life were endangered by refusing them--every man must take care of
himself. If Warwick chose to insist on a policy which the secretary
disapproved--alliance with France abroad, or debasement of coinage at
home--that was Warwick’s business, not the secretary’s: what he had
to do was to carry out the policy imposed on him, with the maximum of
efficiency and the minimum of friction, without allowing himself to be
identified with the policy or with antagonism to it.

So when Warwick made up his mind that Somerset must be finally removed,
it was Cecil’s cue to avoid, so far as he could, taking an active
part in so ungracious a business as his old patron’s destruction--but
certainly not to invite destruction for himself by injudicious
partisanship. He did not scruple even to give Warwick information
injurious to Somerset; though it was probably only because he knew it
would reach that cunning schemer’s ears sooner or later--and when it
came to a choice between profiting or suffering by the inevitable,
he had no qualms about profiting. Still, he managed to be too much
occupied with foreign negotiations to have much to do with the
Somerset affair. As for the foreign negotiations themselves, he did
not make any attempt to counteract the policy which, against his own
judgment, he was called upon to carry out, but he was very seriously
and not unsuccessfully engaged in minimising the untoward consequences
which he foresaw.

As the young king’s death drew manifestly near, the intrigues of
Northumberland, as Warwick had now become, thickened. Sir William--he
had been knighted at the end of 1551--did not like intrigues; but in
spite of seasonable illness, which may have been genuine, he could not
altogether avoid being dragged in, and was obliged--like all the rest
of the Council--to append his signature to the document nominating Lady
Jane Grey heir to the throne. He averred afterwards that he signed
only as a witness--a statement more ingenious than ingenuous. Still,
he took care that there should be evidence from unofficial quarters
that he would have avoided signing if he could, and that so far as he
was formally a participator in Northumberland’s plot it was with no
goodwill to its success--which, indeed, was the attitude of several
other signatories, who did their best to upset the scheme the moment
they felt safe in doing so. Cranmer, however, the most reluctant of any
of them, had no such double-dealing in his mind, and made no attempt
to evade the responsibility when he had once assumed it, though he had
been tricked into acquiescence by a lie.

It is only fair, in judging Cecil’s conduct through these years, to
remember that he was only in his twenty-seventh year when Somerset
became Protector, and in his thirty-third year when Queen Mary
succeeded. Warwick made him Secretary of State eight days before his
thirtieth birthday. Of course, if the errors he committed had been
errors of youth, he would have won easy forgiveness; yet in some
respects his excessive caution may reasonably be attributed to his
youth. He had every excuse for arguing that a real control must be
out of his reach for many years, and that till it came within his
reach he was not called upon to insist on his own views. In those days
the servants of the State did not resign--the remark has been made
before--they carried out the policy imposed on them from above. He was
content, therefore, to bide his time, and for the present to do the
political drudgery for Somerset or Northumberland, while he avoided
committing himself personally to anybody or anything. This course was
not one which permitted the exercise of generosity or magnanimity; it
completely eschewed the idea of self-sacrifice; but it was a course
which he could and did pursue without ever fairly laying himself open
to the charge of treachery, or incurring the faintest suspicion of what
is called corruption. If he was guided by considerations of personal
advantage, it was not in the sense that any one could bid successfully
for his support.

So when Northumberland’s plot collapsed ignominiously, Cecil, although
a Protestant and officially opposed to Gardiner, had no difficulty in
making his peace with the new Government. Only, the political seas
being stormier than ever, he had no inclination either to head an
Opposition or to take a prominent place among the queen’s ministers.
He was too much of a Protestant for that, though not too much so to
conform and “bow himself in the House of Rimmon.” In short, he courted
an obscurity from which the Government had no desire to extract
him--though it is probable that if he had chosen to offer himself as
an instrument for Mary’s use, she would have availed herself of him
readily enough. But it was one thing to pass from Somerset’s employ
to Warwick’s, and another to pass from Northumberland’s to Mary’s.
Besides, by keeping in the background now he could quietly establish
himself in the confidence of the probable successor to the throne,
the Princess Elizabeth. Being a member of the Parliament of 1556, he
therein openly opposed sundry Government measures which were hotly
resisted by the House of Commons, but even then he behaved with
circumspection and did not suffer for his conduct. His real business
was with Elizabeth; and when the crisis came, and Mary died, the
members of the Council who hastened to Hatfield found Cecil already
installed as her Prime Minister elect, with the scheme for carrying on
the Government completely organised.


III

FOREIGN AFFAIRS AT ELIZABETH’S ACCESSION

Sir William had bided his time, and that time had arrived. On the
throne was a young woman of five-and-twenty, who had already shown a
skill akin to Cecil’s own in the avoidance of fatally compromising
words or acts under circumstances when the utmost wariness had been
the constant condition of safety. She had maintained her Protestantism
in precisely the same way and in very much the same degree as he had
done; moreover, she was bound for her own sake to maintain it, since
her personal claim to legitimate birth was bound up with the rejection
of Papal authority. Cecil had received her confidence, it may be, in
part, because she was aware that she could afford to indulge her own
waywardness more freely while she had so eminently safe a counsellor as
a stand-by. He, for his part, was doubtless fully satisfied that she
had intelligence enough to recognise that he was indispensable to her,
and that in the main their views of policy would harmonise. The young
man had held aloof from intrigues and had declined all temptations to
grasp at dangerous power, not from lack of ambition or of patriotism,
but because the power would have been too dearly bought and its
foundations too unstable. Now, while he was still in the prime of life,
yet of ripe experience, power lay ready for him to grasp--power to
guide England in the courses which he believed would serve her best
interests; power to cure the evils from which she had been suffering
for many a year past; power to avert those which menaced her in the
future; power which, once achieved, he was not likely to lose unless
by his own blundering. He knew his own capacity. To refuse power under
such conditions would have been not caution but pusillanimity.

It may be that the account of Cecil’s public life during the reigns of
Edward and Mary gives an impression merely that he was an exceedingly
astute young man with no principles to speak of. If so, that view must
be corrected. He valued himself on his own complete integrity, and
would have done nothing which he recognised as inconsistent therewith.
He had principles, but not enthusiasms. In politics, as in religion,
he had his own opinions, but in both he admitted a very large body
of _adiaphora_, things which were not questions of principle, though
regarded as such by persons afflicted with enthusiasms. On all such
matters, passive or even active conformity to the policy of _de
facto_ rulers was permissible. He was ready to go to Mass, but not to
take a part in the suppression of Protestantism. He would assent to
Northumberland’s plot, but he would not further it. His integrity drew
a line--lower than a person of finer moral susceptibilities would have
drawn it, but with sufficient firmness and decision, and higher than
most of his more prominent contemporaries. He did not feel called upon
to swim against a stream which would overwhelm him if he did so; but
he made for a backwater. It is often difficult to judge when and where
courage becomes rashness, and prudence cowardice. On the whole, he was
more inclined to be too prudent than too bold; but it was not because
he lacked courage. His conduct might on occasion, though rarely, be
charged as disloyal; it could never fairly be called treacherous. He
was convinced that as a general rule honesty is the best policy, and
justice is the best policy; but in the exceptional cases where he
thought they were not, he chose--the best policy. The principles of
his mistress were the same; but she deviated from the mean of resolute
caution more markedly and more erratically than her minister; she was
more readily rash and more easily frightened; her criterion of justice
was lax, and her sense of honesty very nearly non-existent.

There was this very important difference between the state of affairs
on Queen Elizabeth’s accession and their position between 1546 and
1558. Hitherto a statesman, even if perfectly secure of power, would
still have had a difficult course to steer; but security being wanting,
the lack of it was the gravest of all the difficulties. The course of
safety now was not less intricate; but, in spite of appearances, there
was no longer the same risk of incalculable irregular forces wrecking
the ship. To retain a useful illustration or analogy; it was one thing
to be responsible for bringing the ship home “through billows and
through gales,” and another to carry her through a narrow and devious
channel infested with reefs and sandbanks, in fair weather. The pilot
who judged that he knew every inch of the reefs and sandbanks might
feel that the business was an anxious one; to the less discerning
passenger, he would often seem to be heading his vessel straight for
the rocks; but the pilot himself would not feel any fear of finding
himself helpless. As long as he made no mistakes he would be safe; and
if he made mistakes, it would be his own fault.

After the event, when the developments of a particular situation have
taken place, it is always difficult to realise the aspect the situation
itself presented to the statesman who had to deal with it. Still, the
attempt has to be made.

Almost from time immemorial until the reign of Henry VIII. antagonism
between England and France was traditional; through great part of
that period, alliance between England and the House of Burgundy had
also been traditional, being largely based on the immense importance
of the commercial intercourse between the Low Countries and England.
During Henry VIII.’s reign, Wolsey and the king had broken away from
the theory of animosity to France, but neither of them had held the
Burgundian friendship cheap, and popular sentiment had lost very
little of its anti-Gallic flavour. Further, we are apt not to bear in
mind that, for forty years past, Spain, Burgundy, and the Empire had
been combined under one head; the importance of Burgundy as a factor
in the relations with Charles escapes our attention. More or less
unconsciously, we think almost exclusively of France and the Empire; as
in the coming period we think almost exclusively of France and Spain.

Now in 1558 the dominions of Charles V. were divided between his
brother who became Emperor and his son who was lord of Spain and
Burgundy. Philip, not the Emperor, is the rival of the French monarchy.
The old grounds for seeking friendship with Philip as lord of
Burgundy remain. The new reasons for hostility to Philip as King of
Spain have not yet developed. The reigning Pope had been elected by
French influence. The Council of Trent had not yet defined permanently
the line of cleavage between so-called Catholics and Protestants;
Philip had not assumed the position of the Church’s champion and the
scourge of heretics; his influence in England was understood to have
been exerted, so far as it was exercised at all, in mitigation of
persecution.

On the other hand, antagonism between French and English interests
was acute. England, drawn into a French war in Mary’s reign, had just
lost her last foothold on French soil--Calais, which she had held
for three hundred years; and though the loss might not be of great
political or strategical consequence, its importance was magnified
by popular sentiment. But apart from this: the young Queen of Scots
had married the French Dauphin, only in this same year; and as a mere
question of legitimacy, there was no possible doubt that her title to
the throne of England was very much better than that of Elizabeth, who
had been declared illegitimate by the English Courts of Justice, which
judgment had never been formally reversed. The natural outcome of this
marriage would be to bind France and Scotland together in all and more
than all the intimacy of that ancient alliance between them which for
three centuries had been a thorn in the side of English kings. Beyond
that, the future Queen of France and Scotland would have a very much
more tenable claim to the throne of England than ever an English
king had had to the throne of France. Moreover, there was a special
danger threatening under the existing circumstances. Mary was half a
Guise by birth; her Guise mother was now Regent in Scotland; she was
almost wholly Guise by breeding. The presumption was enormous that the
ascendency of that powerful and ambitious family in France and their
influence in Scotland would become more dominant than ever; the Guises
were strongly anti-English, and it was the head of that house who
had just achieved the galling triumph at Calais; while the fanatical
Catholics looked to them as their leaders. A more active animosity,
therefore, towards Protestantism was to be anticipated from France than
from Spain.

The Spanish Minister in England, naturally enough under these
conditions, took it for granted that the countenance of Philip was what
the new Government would most urgently need--that he would merely have
to speak and his instructions would be humbly obeyed. To his extreme
astonishment, he discovered that nothing was further from Cecil’s mind.
Cecil and his mistress signified quite clearly that they would judge
for themselves whether they would take his advice or not. At any rate,
they were going to do a good many things entirely regardless of their
being in flat opposition to his wishes. The Spaniard declared to his
master that Queen and Minister were rushing headlong to destruction;
but they were doing nothing of the kind. What Cecil saw was that
Philip could not at any price afford to withdraw his countenance from
Elizabeth; because the only alternative to Elizabeth was Mary Stewart,
and in that case Mary would unite the crowns of France, England, and
Scotland. If France moved against England to the danger of Elizabeth’s
throne, Philip would have no choice but to interfere on behalf of the
Queen--she need not buy support which he could not afford to withhold.
He might call the tune, but she need not dance to it unless it suited
her.

Within a short period, the French King, Henry II., was mortally injured
in a tournament. The Dauphin succeeded, and his wife became Queen of
France, as well as of Scotland. Then the situation was modified by the
death of Francis and the accession of Charles IX. to the throne, and to
power of the Queen-Mother, Catherine de Medici, and the middle party
who came to be known by the title of the “Politiques.” With them the
Guises were out of favour, and could no longer count on wielding the
power of France to advance Mary’s interests; yet their popularity and
strength in the country were still sufficient to keep the chance of
their recovering their ascendency as a menace which Philip could not
disregard. The change, in short, cut both ways: it was not quite so
imperative for Philip that he should support Elizabeth, but then it was
not so necessary for Elizabeth to have his support.

Thus throughout the first decade of the reign Cecil calculated with
perfect accuracy that Philip would not attack Elizabeth, whatever she
might do, because he could not risk the accession of Mary Stewart in
her place; and that France would not make a direct attack, because that
would compel the intervention of Philip. Hence he could go his own way
safely in dealing both with domestic affairs and with the everlasting
problem of Scotland. There was another matter, that of the Queen’s
marriage, in which Cecil might judge and advise as he thought fit, but
the Queen herself never had the slightest intention of following any
but her own counsel, or of revealing even to her most trusted minister
what that counsel might really be.


IV

DOMESTIC AND SCOTTISH POLICY

Now, as concerned domestic affairs, two matters were of first-rate
importance. One was religion; the other finance.

It was evidently quite necessary that a definite religious settlement
should be arrived at, and that it must be one in which there was a
reasonable prospect of the majority of Englishmen concurring. There
were fervent adherents of the Papacy as restored by Mary; these were
not very numerous. There were fervent adherents of extreme Swiss
doctrines, Calvinistic or Zwinglian; these were also few. There were
many who, like Gardiner in early days, had no love for the Papacy, but
clung to traditional doctrines and ritual; there were not quite so
many who might be called perhaps moderately evangelical; there were a
very great many more who troubled their heads very little one way or
another, and were what we should describe as High or Low, pretty much
according to their environment. The extreme reformers had very nearly
but not quite succeeded in carrying the day during Northumberland’s
ascendency; the extreme Catholics had just had their turn under Mary.
The extremists on both sides were intolerant, and it was quite obvious
that the triumph of either would drive many moderates into joining
the other extreme, and would keep the country in a state of violent
unrest, or, at the best, of sullen submission. The experiment of
trying to maintain traditional doctrine and ritual with the minimum
of modification, while repudiating the Roman authority, had been
tried under Henry; and it was fairly clear that a simple return to
Henry’s standards was impracticable. The course which Cecil laid down
was to adopt a compromise in which the great majority could at any
rate acquiesce; a compromise which, while insisting on conformity,
allowed of a very considerable latitude of interpretation; which would
still pass, in many quarters where it did not satisfy; which was in
short politically adequate. Cecil himself would probably have had no
quite insuperable objection either to attending Mass or to sitting at
Communion; but a compromise which allowed of either course would also
probably have found a less general acceptance than one which excluded
both.

Hardly less important was the restoration of financial stability.
Twelve years before, King Henry had left matters in sufficiently
ill-plight. The Government could not, perhaps, be held responsible
for the existence of severe agricultural depression; but, for its
aggravation, the newly developed class of landlords was largely to
blame, while no one but Somerset had attempted to hold them in check.
In the general ferment, commercial honesty had been on the downgrade.
Among financial officials, corruption had been rampant; and Henry set
the example of one of the grossest forms of dishonesty by debasing
the coinage, paying his debts, when he did pay them, in the debased
coin. Hence in commercial circles credit was bad, while abroad the
national credit was exceedingly low; and the national exchequer was
almost empty. Through the last two reigns, matters had gone from bad
to worse. Cecil took the finances in hand with solid systematic common
sense. A rigid supervision of expenditure and stoppage of waste took
the place of the prevailing laxity. Men of probity were employed by
the Government as its financial agents. The debased coins were called
in, and the new currency issued was of a standard which had never been
surpassed. Loans were repaid with punctuality, and debts discharged.
Almost at once, it followed that fresh loans could be raised at
reasonable rates of interest, instead of at the ruinous charges which
Edward and Mary had to pay; before long, it was hardly necessary to
seek for them abroad--the merchants at home were ready and willing to
come forward. Confidence was restored under a steady Government.

Cecil’s economy may have verged on parsimony, and his mistress was as
sharp in money matters as her grandfather; hard things are always said
of a Government which takes Peace and Retrenchment for its motto. But
peace and retrenchment were a stern necessity, and in many respects
the parsimony has been exaggerated; at any rate, the expenditure
was thoroughly well directed. Later in the reign it would probably
have been sound policy to spend more, particularly in Ireland, where
efficiency was sacrificed to economy; but outside of Ireland the nation
got good value for every penny of outlay. In finance, as in other
matters, Cecil habitually followed the maxims of caution. Consistently
with this attitude, we do not find him striking out new economic
theories. He believed, as nearly every one believed three hundred years
ago, that new industries had very little chance of being established
without the artificial stimulus of monopolies and patents to prevent
competition--a system which always appeals most convincingly to the
monopolist, but less convincingly to the consumer and the would-be
competitor, as Elizabeth found before the end of the reign. Whatever
we may think of the methods adopted to foster and encourage trade
and the development of new industries, Cecil is at least entitled to
full credit for recognising that this was the direction in which the
compensation and the remedy for agricultural depression were to be
sought.

The subject of the secretary’s financial reforms has carried us on to
a general account of principles which were only gradually illustrated
in the progress of the reign. The third question which engaged his
immediate activities on Elizabeth’s accession was the policy to be
followed in dealing with Scotland.

Traditionally, Scotland was the friend of France and the enemy of
England; from which it followed in a general way that Scottish
malcontents habitually looked to England for open or secret
countenance, and very commonly got it. To foster divisions in Scotland
was one way of preventing her from becoming too actively dangerous a
neighbour, and the plan had been very sedulously followed, especially
throughout the reign of Henry VIII. The Scottish clerics since the
days of Bruce had always been strongly anti-English, a term which was
almost equivalent to Nationalist. Both James and David Beton had been
especially hostile; while, during the progress of the Reformation, the
Cardinal was a rigorous and cruel persecutor of heresy. Henry, with
all his pride of orthodoxy, had no objection to heresy in the northern
kingdom, where Protestant and mal-content were nearly synonymous. Had
England devoted her attention simply to giving the Protestants such
support as would have secured them a predominance conditional on the
support being maintained, diplomacy might have achieved the union of
the crowns by the marriage of King Edward to his cousin of Scotland;
but Henry and Somerset between them, by the re-assertion of English
sovereignty and by the appeal to arms, had roused in Protestants as
well as Catholics the nationalist sentiment which would not endure
subjection to England at any price. The child-queen had been carried
off to France and betrothed to the Dauphin; and in the years that
passed before the actual marriage the Catholics had held the mastery;
Mary of Guise was regent, and her power was maintained by French
support and French troops. Thus the Scots began to realise that there
was a danger, when their own Queen should be Queen of France also, that
Scotland might become an appendage of France. Scotland was no more
willing to be subject to France than to be subject to England.

Thus it was again open to Cecil to adopt the policy, not of exercising
a direct English domination, but of establishing a Protestant
domination, which would in the nature of things be favourable to
England and unfavourable to France--a policy which fitted in precisely
with that of establishing a comprehensive Protestantism in England,
to which he was committed on other counts. He could rely, as we have
already noted, on the fact that Philip, however reluctant, would be
compelled to check aggressive interference on the part of France, if
carried beyond the limit at which England could cope with it unaided.
This, therefore, was the keynote of his Scottish policy--to avoid the
blunder of seeming to threaten Scotland’s independence, to maintain
friendly relations with the Scottish Protestants, and to help them to a
predominance which should yet depend for its security on the goodwill
of England.

It was not till December 1560, that the death of Francis deprived
Mary of the French crown. During these first two years of Elizabeth’s
reign, Philip was kept in play partly by a pretence of negotiations
for the Queen’s marriage to his kinsman the Austrian Archduke Charles;
while the Scottish Protestants, or Lords of the Congregation, as their
chiefs were called, were flattered by the idea of her marriage with
James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, who then stood next in succession to the
Scottish throne--a scheme of which the real motive was the possibility
of dethroning Mary in his favour. But the real business was to get
the French out of Scotland. Cecil at last manœuvred his mistress
into sending armed assistance to the Lords of the Congregation; the
French garrison was cooped up in Leith; in May 1560, Sir William went
to Scotland himself to negotiate; in June Mary of Guise died, and in
the beginning of July the Treaty of Edinburgh secured the Protestant
ascendency in Scotland, and removed the French garrison for ever.
Although Queen Mary refused to ratify the instrument, consistently
declining formally to withdraw her claim to the throne of England
unless she were equally formally recognised as heir presumptive,
Cecil’s great object was achieved, in spite of Elizabeth’s vacillations.

Thirteen months later, Mary, an eighteen-year-old widow, landed in
Scotland. During the seven troublous years she passed in that country,
Cecil’s policy remained the same--to support Scottish Protestantism, to
prevent Mary from making a marriage that would be dangerous to England.
It is hardly necessary to say that the methods were never qualified
by any touch of magnanimity--that the interests of England solely were
considered, those of Scotland disregarded. How much of what went on, on
the part of England, was Cecil’s doing and how much Elizabeth’s, cannot
well be decided. They may or may not have intended the Darnley marriage
to take place. They did encourage Moray’s revolt on that occasion, and
then repudiate responsibility for it. They knew something--how much is
uncertain--about the Rizzio murder, before it took place. Generally,
we can be tolerably confident that Cecil, unfettered, would have given
Moray a more stable support throughout than it pleased his mistress to
permit. It was Elizabeth’s standing rule to object vehemently to being
considered as having committed herself to anything by any words or acts
in which she might have indulged.


V

CECIL AND PROTESTANTISM

Cecil had been successful in turning the French out of Scotland.
He held steadily, and the queen held unsteadily, to the conviction
that Spain would not move against England for two reasons--one, that
the triumph of the Scots queen would be too advantageous to France;
the other, that the existing commercial war with the Low Countries,
while bad enough for English trade, was threatening to ruin Flanders,
and could hardly fail to do so if any further burden were added.
France, on the other hand, was not likely to be actively dangerous
independently, so long as neither Catholics nor Huguenots could lay
the opposing party prostrate. Nevertheless, Cecil had to be constantly
on guard against the risk of a Catholic combination. If Mary placed
herself under the ægis of Philip, and the Guises and their following
got his active support in France--if he played to the French Catholics
the part which England was playing to the Scottish Protestants--he
might reckon himself free of the fear of French advancement. The thing
was not a probability, but it was a chance against which England had
to be on the watch. Every time, however, that a crisis of this kind
threatened, or that a Spanish ambassador hinted that his master would
feel himself driven into active antagonism, the Secretary refused to
be frightened; direct threats always stiffened his mistress; and his
calculation turned out correct.

At the bottom of Cecil’s whole system of foreign policy was the theory
that Philip as Lord of Burgundy could not, for commercial reasons,
afford to quarrel with England, and as King of Spain was tied by the
danger of strengthening France. Spain, then, was not to be feared, but
France might be; this, however, would be conditional on the Huguenots
being decisively crushed--a consummation not desired by Catherine
and the _Politiques_; but this, in turn, required that the French
Huguenots should have enough support from England to maintain their
power of resistance, if not their domination. As time went on, and
the Protestant Netherlands found themselves in open armed resistance
to Philip, it was in just the same way necessary for England to keep
them from being crushed. Cecil saw the necessity of thus abetting
the Protestants in Scotland, France, and the Netherlands; and, being
a genuine Protestant if not an over-ardent one, did not dislike it.
Elizabeth saw the necessity also, but as in each case the Protestants
were subjects acting in opposition to the Government, she did
dislike it, and lost no opportunity of making the support she gave
as ungracious, as niggardly, and as precarious as she dared, while
she perpetually kept up a sort of pretence to herself as well as to
others that she was not really helping those whom she called rebels.
Yet without the help that was wrung from her, it is doubtful whether
in France, in the Netherlands, or even in Scotland, the issue of the
struggles during her reign would not have been materially different.

Now Cecil’s ideal was one of sober and opulent respectability; he was
not troubled with any notion that the Pope was the Scarlet Woman;
he held generally to the view that subjects ought to conform to the
religion prescribed by Government. But where the views which he himself
held were not prescribed but proscribed, decency compelled sympathy
with the sufferers. Besides, the suppression of Protestantism outside
of England would inevitably mean its suppression in England also, in
course of time. He was thoroughly satisfied that Protestantism was best
for England, and thus, although he had no abstract interest in what
might be good for other countries, for England’s sake he was satisfied
that Protestantism must not be suppressed elsewhere. This was the mark
up to which he had to keep the Queen--who, for her part, was quite
aware that the security of her throne depended on her sustaining the
part laid down for her. But Cecil’s minimum was her maximum, whereas
his maximum--with which she would have nothing to do--was the minimum
that would have satisfied her other great minister, Walsingham.

Elizabeth, we may put it, felt that Protestantism was a political
necessity for her personal government. She did not feel strongly
that it would still be a necessity for England when she should be in
her grave. Cecil did; while for Walsingham it was a necessity _per
se_. Therefore, to Elizabeth the settlement of the succession was a
political counter of which she did not choose to be deprived; while
to her ministers the delay of it was a perpetual nightmare, because
it meant a constant fear of the accession of Mary Stewart--a prospect
even more threatening after she had left Scotland than while she was a
reigning queen. Herein is to be found one of the reasons why Elizabeth
was not anxious to get rid of a prisoner round whom--dangerous though
Mary might be--she could weave intrigues and negotiations as well as
her opponents; whereas Cecil and Walsingham would always have been
pleased to find any decent excuse for eliminating the Scots Queen from
the situation. In the same way, the ministers wanted their own Queen
to make a suitable marriage, whereas she herself used matrimonial
negotiations merely as tricks for circumventing crises, and probably
never at any time really intended to wed any one among the numerous
suitors, of whom the last did not finally disappear till she was in her
fiftieth year. There is no practical doubt that at one time, early in
the reign, Cecil was himself so much perturbed on the question of the
succession as to have made a move in co-operation with Nicholas Bacon
to get Katharine Grey--sister of Lady Jane, and now married to Lord
Hertford--recognised officially as heir presumptive in accordance with
the terms of the will of Henry VIII.; for which he very nearly got into
serious trouble. Also, it was many years before the Secretary really
felt thoroughly free from the fear, which Elizabeth enjoyed holding in
suspense over his head, that she might some day throw policy to the
winds and court ruin by marrying Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.


VI

ELIZABETH’S SECOND PERIOD

The year 1568 and those immediately following had a very material
effect on the general situation. In the first place, the Queen of Scots
delivered herself into Elizabeth’s hands, having already forfeited some
of her chances of foreign support by her marriage with Bothwell. In the
second place, the disaffected provinces of the Netherlands were driven
into open revolt. Broadly speaking, it may be said that from this time
forward Philip always wished to crush Elizabeth, while he would not
involve himself in war with England until he could reckon on crushing
her decisively. There was always the possibility of an Anglo-French
combination, involving Huguenot predominance in France; and in that
event the fleets of the two Powers would command his only line of
communication with the Netherlands. So that on the one hand Spaniards
are found, throughout Mary’s captivity, engaged in plot after plot for
her liberation and enthronement in England; while on the other, Philip
is obliged to swallow one affront after another, and to vary threats
of utter destruction with elaborate efforts to placate the Queen of
England. Cecil--Lord Burghley, as he became in 1571--was no less
anxious to avoid war, but was also determined to go as far as might be,
short of war, in support of the insurgent provinces; while steadily
accumulating the evidence of Spanish complicity in Marian plots, to
be produced as an effective answer to any complaints that England was
abetting treason in the Netherlands, or her seamen committing acts of
war in the Spanish Main or the West Indian Islands.

The Protestantism of the Government stiffened inevitably with the
development of Catholic plots centring on Mary, the atrocities
perpetrated by Alva in the Netherlands, the cruelties practised by the
Spanish Inquisition on English sailors who fell into its hands, and the
blundering Papal Bull of deposition--which, in fact, embarrassed Philip
a good deal more than it injured the Queen of England. This singularly
impolitic act of the Roman Pontiff, emphasising the direct antagonism,
not to say the irreconcilability, of loyalty to the Throne and loyalty
to the Church, sufficed in itself to bring all Catholics under
suspicion of being at heart traitors--in the technical sense; pledged
by their faith to desire, if not actively to compass, the overthrow of
the reigning queen. Preceded, as it was, by the insurrection of the
northern Catholic Earls in Mary’s favour, and followed by the Ridolfi
conspiracy, it is difficult to perceive how the Queen’s government
could have done otherwise than assume that to be a Catholic was to be
disaffected. Nor is it possible to imagine that, after the appalling
St. Bartholomew massacres of 1572, anti-Catholic sentiment in the
country was not intensified to a white heat.

The people of England had a further grievance against Spain, inasmuch
as she had taken possession of the wealth of the New World, and
meant to keep it for herself--whereas the English desired a share.
Throughout the later sixties and the seventies, English adventurers
were engaged in making good their claims, in spite of nominal peace
and law, by force of arms, raiding Spanish settlements or compelling
local authorities to allow them to trade in defiance of all injunctions
from headquarters. Technically, at least, these proceedings amounted
to piracy, and if the Spaniards had been content to treat their
perpetrators as pirates, it would have been extremely difficult to
protest. Having an almost incontrovertible case, the Spaniards elected
to put themselves in the wrong by punishing their prisoners--when they
caught them--not as pirates but as heretics, gratuitously introducing
the religious factor. Even in 1568 English sailors, under such captains
as John Hawkins, had learnt to feel that ship for ship they were very
much more than a match for Spanish galleons. Thus the most adventurous
and most irrepressible class in the community was athirst to measure
its strength with the Spaniard, and found no difficulty in convincing
itself that to do so was a religious duty. The spirit of rivalry,
greed of wealth, and sheer love of adventure, formed a sufficiently
strong combination of motives; zeal against the persecutors of true
religion gave them a colour which satisfied any but the most fastidious
consciences.

Now, it will be easy to see from the foregoing paragraphs that already
in 1568 enough had occurred to inflame popular feeling against
Spain. There were the doings of the Spanish Inquisition in respect
of English sailors. There was, amongst other grievances, the attack
on John Hawkins at San Juan d’Ulloa. There was Alva’s tyranny in
the Netherlands. In France, no one could tell whether Huguenots or
Catholics were going to get the upper hand; but Philip was fully
committed to the suppression of heresy within his own dominions, and
outside them as well so far as it might lie in his power. During the
next four years, every event of importance went to intensify the
sentiment against Spain, to which, and not to France, the Ridolfi plot
pointed as Mary’s ally. On the other hand, it was evident at once,
when Elizabeth was able to detain in her own ports for her own use
the treasure which was on its way up channel to help Alva, that for
the time Philip was too heavily hampered to be able to turn his full
strength against England; and as time went on it became increasingly
clear that Spain could not, with the Netherlands revolt on her hands,
contemplate an English war with equanimity. Even Saint Bartholomew did
not divert the hostile sentiment in the direction of France, since
still after the massacre it was difficult to say whether the French
nation should be identified with the party of the perpetrators rather
than with that of the victims.

At the lowest estimate, then, there was a mass of feeling in the
country which could very easily have been fanned into a blaze of
indignation, imperatively demanding open defiance of Spain, vigorous
support of the Netherlands and of the Huguenots--in short, immediate
war instead of the chance of war in the future. But the Queen and
Burghley were determined to avoid war; and for nearly twenty years they
succeeded. Burghley’s own primary conviction was that amity between
Burgundy and England was of such enormous importance to both that
considerations of policy would prevent Philip, as they had prevented
his father, from being dragged into war by considerations of religious
zeal. Protestantism--so much of it, at least, as was necessary--could
be saved, probably without adopting heroic courses; and in any case,
if a duel should ultimately prove inevitable, every year that it was
deferred would tell in favour of England, which was daily growing in
wealth, in stability, and in efficiency; and against Spain, which
was constantly subjected to the exhausting strain of war in the Low
Countries and war with the Turk.

Ultimate friendship with Spain, on the basis of immunity for
unaggressive Protestantism, mutual toleration, and unfettered trade,
was broadly the ideal for which Burghley worked; to achieve it, he was
ready to bring to bear any amount of pressure which would not actually
precipitate war. But it was part of the policy always to make sure that
there was, at any rate, technical justification for everything done
by the English Government. This technical correctness is particularly
characteristic of the man. While Elizabeth herself and nearly every man
in her court, were all shareholders, or in some degree interested, in
the privateering expeditions of Drake and other captains, Burghley held
himself rigidly aloof from them, and never made a penny of personal
profit in that way. He had no moral qualms about seizing the Genoese
treasure in 1568--that was merely an arrangement by which the bankers
lent to England money which they had intended to lend to Spain; if it
inconvenienced Spain, Spain should not have seized the English ships
in her harbours. But when Drake came home after sailing round the
world, with vast quantities of captured treasure in the _Golden Hind_,
Burghley stigmatised the whole proceedings as piratical, declined any
share of the spoil, and would have had it restored to Spain.

In this connection, the Lord Treasurer’s[E] aversion to these raiding
expeditions was so strong that when Drake’s great voyage was in
contemplation the utmost pains were taken to keep the matter out of his
knowledge. But there were very few things that Burghley did not succeed
in being aware of; and one of the gentleman-adventurers who sailed in
that expedition, Thomas Doughty, was in personal communication with
him before it started. This man was executed by Drake at Port St.
Julian, in Patagonia--one of the grounds on which he was held guilty
of treason towards the “General,” Drake, being that he had admittedly
revealed as much as he knew to Burghley. The fact that inquiry into
that execution was carefully shirked, while the recorded evidence is
somewhat contradictory and inconclusive, has led to the formation of
various surmises to the disfavour of Drake, of Burghley, of Doughty,
or of the witnesses, according to the point of view of the critic. The
most natural interpretation would seem to be that in the first place
Drake and the sailors in general suspected gentleman-adventurers at
large of being an objectionably insubordinate and troublesome element;
and the General may very possibly have been injudicially ready to
condemn one of them on insufficient evidence--evidence which satisfied
him but did not amount to legal proof--and fancied that collusion with
the antagonistic Lord Treasurer implied certainly ill-will and probably
treachery to the commander. Applying those current rules of evidence
which repeatedly sufficed to condemn men for treason at home, the
case for executing Doughty was quite strong enough to act on, though
exceedingly awkward to make public. It would show, of course, that the
sailor was very suspicious of the designs of the statesman from whom
the Queen wanted to have the thing concealed; it also suggests that
Elizabeth liked to do behind the minister’s back, if she could manage
it, the things which she knew he would disapprove. But it does not
involve anything outrageous on Drake’s part, or any real discredit to
the Lord Treasurer.

      [E] Burghley was made Lord High Treasurer in 1572.

In fact, for a dozen years after Saint Bartholomew, while Burghley
and the Queen had the same main object in view, though others of the
Council were urgent in favour of her presenting herself openly as
the champion of Protestantism, Burghley’s difficulties were mainly
of Elizabeth’s creating. To all appearance, she was in a state of
ceaseless vacillation--now on the verge of a shameful betrayal of
Orange, now on the brink of a French marriage, now on the point of
announcing her readiness to head a League of Protestants, now of
allowing them to take their chance with the preposterous Alençon
as their figure-head, while she stood aside, and anon dangling her
matrimonial bait before that luckless and incapable prince as a
preferable alternative. Burghley, Walsingham, all her advisers, were
repeatedly driven almost to despair by her vagaries; none knew what her
next twist would be--yet every twist that seemed to produce a fresh
entanglement was followed by another which evaded it; and always as an
open breach with Spain or a flagrant rupture with France seemed really
a thing immediately inevitable, some happy accident appeared to save
the situation once more.


VII

THE WAR WITH SPAIN

It would seem, however, that the discovery of the Throgmorton
conspiracy led Burghley in the beginning of 1584 to the conclusion that
a bolder support should be given to the Netherlands, more especially
as the Alençon farce was finished. In 1585, Elizabeth committed
herself to the Hollanders, Drake went off on the Cartagena raid, and
in 1586 Leicester was in the Low Countries in command of the English
troops. Then came the Babington plot, the execution of the Queen of
Scots after the New Year, the certainty of Philip’s preparations for
the Armada, and the “singeing of the King of Spain’s beard” by Drake,
which deferred the great invasion for a twelvemonth; finally the
week-long battle with the Armada itself, ending in its destruction
off Gravelines, and subsequent annihilation by the tempests. To the
very last Elizabeth went on playing at negotiations with Parma, on
lines involving the basest treachery to the Hollanders; to the entire
satisfaction of Sir James Crofts whom she employed in the business, and
who is known to have been in Philip’s pay. This, however, was merely
one of her regular pieces of diplomatic play-acting; while Burghley
kept his own counsel. The war-party lived on thorns; they did not know
what to make of the trickery, whether it was genuine or a sham. Howard
of Effingham, in fiery wrath, wrote--quoting an old byword--of the
“long grey beard with a white head witless that to all the world would
prove England heart-less,” _i.e._, cowardly. Still, though it would
have been natural enough for them to suspect that the peace-loving
Burghley was abetting the Queen, the probabilities are that Effingham
was referring not to him but to Crofts. Retreat without dishonour was
impossible; he certainly would not have advocated it seriously; and
the elaborate farce which Elizabeth deliberately played was merely a
piece of that eternally baffling and exasperating diplomacy of which
she might be called the inventor and patentee--methods which Burghley
always condemned, though probably his long experience of them had by
this time taught him to see through them. From 1584 he recognised that
events had forced his own peace-loving policy out of court, and that it
could not be revived till the issue between England and Spain had been
fought out. The completeness of England’s triumph when the combatants
did crash together in mortal fray went far, at any rate, to justify the
theory on which he had systematically acted that, if the fight must
come, the longer it could be staved off the more decisively it would
favour his own country.

The wild outburst of enthusiasm following on the defeat of the Armada
very nearly delivered the future of England into the hands of the
Protestant war-party, whose desire was to break the power of Spain
to pieces; and through the winter Drake and Norreys were preparing
for the Lisbon expedition which, as they planned it, would have
been another very crushing blow to Philip. But the great victory
had brought Burghley’s ideal back into the sphere of practical
politics. That is, if English and Spaniards could be brought to see
reason, or to act as if they saw reason, an _entente_ might now be
established securing religious toleration and the recognition of the
old Constitution in the Netherlands, the old Burgundian alliance with
its corollary of commercial privileges and legitimate trading with
Spanish settlements all over the world, and the immunity of English
sailors from the Inquisition. With Spain as an allied Power, whatever
might come of the party strife in France, England would have nothing
to fear. The aggressive sentiment in England was, indeed, too strong
to be repressed; but though the present continuation of the war was
inevitable, it might be so manipulated as to bring it home to the
obstinate mind of Philip that peace on Burghley’s terms would be a very
good bargain for him, without making a total wreck of the power of
Spain.

Elizabeth, as usual, was at one with Burghley on the point, and with
Burghley’s son Robert Cecil, who was now drawing to the front and
making it possible for his father to transfer to him much of the
burden of active work for which he was becoming unfitted by age. The
main method by which the policy was given effect was by placing the
conduct of the war as far as possible in the hands of that section of
the war-party, headed by John Hawkins among the seamen and by Essex
at Court, which thought more of booty than of Empire--which did not
realise, with Drake and Raleigh, that the despoiling of treasure-fleets
and the sacking of ports would accomplish very much less than the
annihilation of fighting fleets and the establishment in the New World
of rival English settlements. Thus, by the time Drake started for
Lisbon, he found his hands so tied by restrictions as to what he was to
do and what he was not to do that the expedition failed of its purpose.
Drake was discredited in consequence, and for some years the war became
a mere series of raids; conducted in force, indeed, and openly avowed
and authorised by the Queen, but not in essence differing from the
semi-piratical performances of the Drakes and Hawkinses when Spain
and England were nominally at peace. Hence, in 1598, when Burghley
and Philip both died within a few weeks of each other, Spain had been
invariably defeated in every successive attempt to strike a blow at her
rival; she had suffered a serious disaster at Cadiz; her treasure-ships
had been repeatedly raided; her enemy, Henry of Navarre, had carried
the day in France: but her hold on the New World remained, she was
still an effective Power in Europe, and the fear of her was not yet
dead, though England still held, and more than held, the priority she
had won ten years before.


VIII

AN APPRECIATION

In foreign policy we have seen that, at any rate in the broader
aspects of it, Burghley and Elizabeth were at one--that is, the Queen
never departed so far from the path he laid down but that she could
regain her footing thereon the moment a crisis arrived. That policy
may be summed up as aiming at one issue--friendship with Spain on an
equality--while preparing for the alternative, a fight for the mastery.
The policy failed to achieve the preferable issue, but in its secondary
aspect was completely successful. Burghley’s own methods were not of
the heroic type; there was no glamour of chivalry and knight-errantry
about them; they were untouched by magnanimity, generosity, moral
enthusiasm; they were ruled by a devotion to law and order, to
propriety, to sober respectability; they were entirely practical,
unsympathetic; but they were essentially marked at least with the
intention of strict justice and reasonableness.

The same characteristics present themselves in his domestic policy. In
the religious settlement and in finance the course taken throughout
the reign is along the broad lines laid down by him; the Queen permits
herself to indulge in personal outbreaks, and sets the general scheme
at naught in individual instances, but, if she flies off at a tangent,
still manages to return before it is too late, before any general
deflection has been brought about. And again the desire of essential
practical justice is the predominating feature. Zeal for particular
religious views, however sincere, must not be permitted to disturb
public order; the decencies must be observed, but the decencies would
allow of as much latitude as reasonable men could desire. If zeal
went the length of harbouring and fostering persons whose doctrines
might be interpreted as impugning the right of the Queen to sit on
the throne of England, justice required that such zeal should be
penalised; if, further, zeal propagated such doctrines actively, zeal
became treason. So, when Parsons and Campion came over with their
propaganda, the Catholic persecution which followed had Burghley’s
entire approval; nonconformity, aggressive and abusive, he was quite
ready to punish with severity, but when Archbishop Whitgift and his
Court of High Commission set about hunting for nonconformity, Burghley
was for restraining them though the Queen sympathised not with him
but with them. A more sensitive and sympathetic imagination would
often have been alive to the existence of real injustice where the
Lord Treasurer failed to perceive it; but where he did perceive it he
always endeavoured to moderate it, even though he might not set his
face stubbornly against it. His gorge rose at the stories of atrocities
perpetrated in Ireland which almost every one else seems to have taken
as a matter of course. If the use of the rack met with his approval it
was only in cases where he honestly believed that the ends of justice
were thereby furthered; and though the practice had not been common in
England, its prevalence elsewhere was so general that its increased
employment involved no shock to the moral sense of contemporaries.

Burghley’s principles of political action, then, were quite remote
from those of Machiavelli and Thomas Cromwell, according to which
the slightest claim of political expediency outweighed the entire
moral code, and ethical considerations were reduced at the best to a
sentiment which under certain circumstances it might be expedient to
humour. His principles were equally remote from those of Somerset,
which ignored the fact that no ends, however noble, can be achieved
by disregarding hard facts. He insisted on upholding a moral standard
in policy, and maintained a moral standard in his personal political
relations. Admitting the principle _salus populi suprema lex_, he
allowed that supreme necessity might over-ride the moral law, but there
were few of his contemporaries who were not very much readier than he
to recognise such an exigency on slight provocation. On the other hand,
while his personal standard was so high that even his bitterest foes
among the Spanish ambassadors acknowledged it with abusive candour,
his normal political standard was that of his times. We may, perhaps,
express it by saying that he had an almost abnormally strong sense of
political proprieties but a complete absence of moral fervour.

Intellectually, he lacked imagination, while no statesman was
ever endowed with a more imperturbably shrewd common sense, which
served as perpetual ballast to counteract the flightiness of his
mistress. He worked as assiduously as Philip of Spain himself, but,
unlike Philip, he knew when to trust other men, never misplacing his
confidence--whereas Philip never trusted any other man an inch further
than he could help. Burghley’s extreme caution was due, not to lack
of courage or of self-confidence, but to a thorough distrust of all
emotional impulses. He weighed, deliberated, decided on the merits of
each case as it arose, with careful and safe judgment; but had none of
those flashes of intuitive perception which have characterised the most
triumphant types of political genius. He ruled, not by magnetism, but
by tact. Among statesmen he was of the order of Walpole and Peel, not
of Oliver Cromwell and Chatham. He was lacking in creative imagination;
but he was, perhaps, the most thoroughly level-headed minister who
has ever guided the destinies of England. He cannot be elevated into
an object of hero-worship. But he was precisely the type of man of
whom his country had most need at the helm in the second half of the
sixteenth century; and he served her as perhaps no other man could
have done, with unswerving patriotism, sturdy resolution, and infinite
devotion to duty.




SIR FRANCIS WALSINGHAM


I

WALSINGHAM’S CHARACTER

Of the many Englishmen, who, by loyal service to the nation in the
reign of the Virgin Queen, deserved well of the State, there is perhaps
not one whose claim stands higher than that of Walsingham. For twenty
years, or near it, Elizabeth trusted him more completely than any of
her council, except Burghley, relied on his ability and his fidelity
to carry out every task of exceptional difficulty, profited by his
devotion, his penetration, and his resourcefulness, rejected his
advice on the cardinal question of policy till she was compelled by
circumstances in some measure to adopt it, suffered him to ruin his
fortunes in her service, and finally permitted him to die the poorest
of all her Ministers. It was said, in the study of Burghley, that she
was loyal to him; she was so, in the sense that nothing would induce
her to part from him. Unlike many other princes, when she found a good
servant, she never let him go from personal pique, or on account of
differences; her loyalty was the loyalty of a very acute woman, but one
wholly devoid of generosity. His loyalty she left to be its own reward.

Walsingham won his position by sheer force of ability and character;
qualities in him which were probably discovered by the penetration
of William Cecil, with whom he was always on the most cordial terms,
although himself the advocate of a much bolder policy than was favoured
by the cautious Lord Treasurer. None could say of Walsingham, as his
enemies have said of Cecil, that he was in any degree a time-server;
he was not only as incorruptible, but it could never be hinted that in
affairs of State his line of action was deflected by a hair’s-breadth
by any considerations of personal advantage or advancement. He indulged
in none of those arts of courtiership which not only a Leicester, a
Hatton, or an Essex, but even a Raleigh, took no shame in employing to
extravagance. Not Knollys nor Hunsdon, her own outspoken kinsmen, could
be more blunt and outspoken to their royal mistress than he. It would
be difficult to find in the long roll of English statesmen one more
resolutely disinterested, or one whose services, being admittedly so
great, were rewarded so meagrely.

[Illustration: _SIR FRANCIS WALSINGHAM_

_From an Engraving by_ G. VERTUE, _after the picture by Holbein, in the
British Museum_]

There are diversities of conscientiousness. Henry VIII. referred most
questions to his conscience, after he had made up his mind about the
answer; and his conscience always endorsed his judgment. Cromwell
ignored conscience altogether; with More, it overruled every other
consideration. Burghley’s was tolerably active, but perhaps somewhat
obtuse. Walsingham, if we read him aright, was as rigidly conscientious
as More himself; but his moral standard requires to be understood
before it can be appreciated. It was derived, not from the New
Testament, but from the Old. It assumed that the Protestants were in
the position of the ancient Hebrews; that they were the Chosen People,
and their enemies, the enemies of the Lord of Sabaoth. It justified the
spoiling of the Egyptians. It was sufficiently tempered to disapprove
the extermination of the Canaanite, but it hardly condemned Ehud and
Jael. Broadly speaking it applied different moral codes in dealing with
the foes of the Faith and in other relations. Identifying the foes
of the Faith with the enemies of the State, it authorised the use,
in self-defence, of every weapon and every artifice employed on the
other side. It was not with him as with those to whom the law serves
for conscience; who will do with a light heart anything that the law
permits, and shrink in horror from anything that it condemns. Nor did
he act on the principle that the right must give way to the expedient.
With him, conscience positively approved in one group of relations the
adoption of practices which in other relations it would have sternly
denounced. That type of conscience is absolutely genuine and sincere;
but it permits actions which are, to say the least, censurable from a
more enlightened point of view.


II

WALSINGHAM’S RISE

The records of Walsingham’s early years are somewhat scanty. An uncle
was Lieutenant of the Tower during the latter part of the reign of
Henry VIII.; of whom it is reported that when Anne Askew was on
the rack, he refused to strain the torture to the point desired
by Wriothesly. His father was a considerable landed proprietor at
Chiselhurst, and filled sundry minor legal offices. He died in 1533,
leaving several daughters and one son, Francis, an infant, born not
earlier than 1530, and so ten years younger than William Cecil. Young
Walsingham was up at King’s College, Cambridge, from 1548 to 1550, and
entered Gray’s Inn in 1552.

Being of the advanced Reformation party, young Walsingham quitted the
country on Mary’s accession, remained abroad during the five years of
her rule, and returned when Elizabeth succeeded, to take his place in
the House of Commons. His sojourn abroad emphasised his Protestantism;
he utilised it also to acquire a very extensive knowledge of foreign
affairs, though he omitted to make himself a master of the Spanish
tongue. He does not appear to have taken prominent part in the
affairs of Parliament when he came back to England; but he attracted
Cecil’s notice, and was employed by the Secretary in procuring secret
intelligence, of which the earliest definite record is a report of
August 1568, giving a “descriptive list of suspicious persons arriving
in Italy during the space of three months,” obtained from “Franchiotto
the Italian.” On November 20 of the same year, he writes to Cecil to
say that, if the evidence of Mary’s complicity in Darnley’s murder
is insufficient, “my friend is able to discover certain that should
have been employed in the said murder, who are here to be produced.”
Incidentally, it may be remarked that this, of course, means no more
than that Walsingham knew where to lay his hand on some one who
professed to have information; which Mr. Froude renders by a phrase
implying that he actually had information, known to be valuable, ready
to be brought forward. What it really shows is, that Walsingham was
engaged in looking out for anything which offered a chance of being
turned to account.

In the autumn of the following year, just before the rising of the
northern earls, when it was practically certain that some kind of
Catholic plot was afoot and that the Spanish ambassador, Don Guerau
de Espes was mixed up in it, circumstances brought the Florentine
banker Ridolfi under suspicion. The position to which Walsingham
was now attaining is shown by the Italian being assigned to his
surveillance--with the result that Ridolfi’s house and papers were
thoroughly searched without his knowledge, but also without the
discovery of anything incriminating. Whether honestly or with the
object of deceiving him, Ridolfi was thereupon treated as if no
vestige of suspicion attached to him. In the modern phrase, it was
an integral part of Walsingham’s system in dealing with persons on
whom he expected to pounce when his own time came, to give them every
inch of rope he could afford: but a year later Walsingham wrote about
the man to Cecil in terms which imply that the belief in his honesty
was genuine. When the whole of the Ridolfi plot was revealed in 1571,
Walsingham was in France. The secret service was Cecil’s creation,
not Walsingham’s, though doubtless the latter had a considerable
share in organising it, and a little later became mainly responsible
for controlling it. Valuable as he was already rendering himself, he
only emerges definitely into the front rank on his appointment as a
special envoy to the French Court in August 1570; followed immediately
thereafter by his selection for the post of Ambassador Resident.

The situation at this time was exceedingly critical. At home, the
northern insurrection had just been suppressed, Norfolk and others of
the peers were very much subjects of suspicion, and the Papal Bull
of deposition had increased the sense of nervousness. The Spanish
representative in England was the hot-headed and intriguing Don Guerau
de Espes; in the Netherlands, Alva had made the world in general
believe--though he knew better himself--that the revolt was crushed.
In France the Huguenots, despite defeat in the field, had just shown
themselves strong enough to obtain, through the balancing party of the
Politiques, terms which placed them fairly on a level with the Guise
faction; but a marriage was being planned between Henry of Anjou, the
king’s next brother and heir presumptive, and the imprisoned Queen of
Scots. In Scotland itself, the assassination of Moray had revived the
confusion which the sombre regent had been struggling to allay. Thus,
there was danger to Elizabeth’s throne from her own Catholic subjects;
danger from France, since Anjou was regarded as of the Guise party; and
danger, imagined at least, from Spain, where that surprising charlatan,
Stukely, had almost, if not quite, persuaded Philip that at his
call--with some armed assistance--all Ireland would rise, fling off the
English yoke, and offer itself to Spain. As a matter of fact, Philip
was much too heavily hampered to take openly aggressive action against
England at the time--but that was known to very few people besides
himself and Alva.

These difficulties of Philip’s were the first redeeming feature in
the situation. The second was that on which Cecil always relied, that
the national interests of France and Spain were too antagonistic to
permit of any cordial alliance between them. Mary Stewart on the
English throne as Philip’s _protégée_ would not suit France; as Anjou’s
wife she would not suit Philip. France might at any time see her own
interest in fostering the revolt in the Netherlands and intriguing for
their Protectorate. The third point was that in France itself, the
Politiques were at one with the Huguenots in wishing to avoid the union
of Anjou with Mary, which would be a great victory for the Guises; so
that the balance of forces in France would turn definitely in favour of
England if she could offer anything in the way of a make-weight.

Such were the conditions under which Walsingham was sent to France as a
special envoy in August 1570--to congratulate the French Government on
the pacification just concluded; to urge the necessity of maintaining
it loyally; and to dissuade the Court from espousing the cause of the
Scots Queen. Within a month, he received official intimation that the
resident Ambassador, Sir Henry Norris, was about to be recalled, and he
was himself to succeed to the post; which arrangement took effect in
January.


III

AMBASSADOR AT PARIS

In the interval, an ingenious solution of several problems had
suggested itself to the Huguenot leaders, and found favour with the
Queen-Mother. This was that Anjou should drop the idea of marrying
Mary and should instead marry Elizabeth herself. He was her junior
by seventeen years, but that was a small matter. If he wedded the
Protestant Queen, he would be definitely detached from the Guises,
toleration for both religions would be assured both in England and
France, and the two countries could join in the liberation of the
Netherlands. The problem would be to arrange the marriage on terms
which would give the parties who were favourably disposed to it
security for the carrying out of those parts of the programme which
were from their several points of view essential.

_Prima facie_ the plan was acceptable to the Huguenots, to the
Politiques, to the English Council, and to Walsingham himself. To the
Guises, it was very much the reverse, and they tried, with a degree
of success, to frighten the Duke with the old scandals about the
Virgin Queen and Leicester. The Spaniards were much perturbed. Their
Ambassador first tried to draw the French into engagements with them
against Orange; and, failing in that attempt, began making overtures
to Walsingham which he appreciated at their true value. He knew all
about the overtures to France--to which, as the Englishman wrote drily
to Cecil, “the answers falling not out to his contentment, maketh
him, as I suppose, to think that the friendship of England is worth
the having.” The same letter notes information that the Pope has a
“practice in hand for England, which would not be long before it brake
forth”--no doubt in connexion with the Ridolfi plot, which was now
maturing.

Side by side with the business of the Anjou marriage, Walsingham was
much engaged in gathering information as to the suspected Spanish
expedition to Ireland; in respect of which he held much diplomatic
conversation with the ex-Archbishop of Cashel and heard many tales of
Stukely’s doings and sayings. Walsingham suspected his good faith,
and remarked significantly to Cecil--who had just been “ordered to
write William Burleigh” instead of William Cecil, but had still some
difficulty in remembering the new signature--“I have placed some
especially about him, to whom he repaireth, as also who repairs unto
him.” The suspicions were not dissipated as time went on.

The Ambassador’s situation was one of singular difficulty. For a dozen
years past, Elizabeth had played fast and loose with so many suitors
that any lack of straightforwardness on her part was certain to be
construed as meaning that she intended to play with Anjou in the same
way; while she was absolutely incapable of being straightforward. As
a matter of fact, she was probably merely playing her usual game. So
long as the match was on the _tapis_, but only on the _tapis_, Philip
would be afraid to move lest he should precipitate it. Meantime, Orange
was making ready to renew the struggle in the Netherlands, and she
might presently find that she could afford to manœuvre herself out
of the marriage, and would have skill enough to make the rupture of
negotiations come from the other side. Burghley and Leicester both
wanted the match--the former being satisfied that it would result in
the Burgundian dominions being separated from Spain without being
absorbed by France, while Protestantism would be generally much
strengthened. But in his private correspondence with Walsingham, he
warned the Ambassador very plainly that neither he nor Leicester knew
what the Queen meant to do--it was as likely as not that she wished in
the long run to get the match broken off by Anjou on the score of the
English stipulations for his conforming to the English law in matters
of religion. Walsingham, who was a Protestant with his heart and soul
as well as his head, and believed that the Protestant cause was the
national cause much more uncompromisingly than Burghley, was more
zealous on behalf of the marriage than the Secretary himself, being
convinced that it would bring about the victory of Protestantism, in
alliance with England, both in France and the Netherlands.

It was not Burghley nor Walsingham, but Elizabeth, who controlled the
situation; and however strongly the ministers might express their
private feelings to each other, they had to do as she told them. Her
trickery met with its usual success. In due course, Henry of Anjou
found that he could not accede to the demand for conformity, and in
spite of his mother’s entreaties withdrew his suit; yet the business
was so successfully managed that the French court, instead of being
offended, very soon began to hint that the French king had yet another
brother, the Duke of Alençon, whose hand and heart were not yet
disposed of. So the play began again.

Meantime the complete revelation of the Ridolfi conspiracy brought
conclusive proofs of the real hostility of Spain to Elizabeth. In the
following spring (1572) the Netherlands were set ablaze once more by
La Marck’s capture of Brille, and Alva found his hands full; a timely
occurrence, since the crushing defeat of the Turks at Lepanto by Don
John in October had greatly strengthened the hands of Philip. In the
summer of 1572 Walsingham was more than ever convinced that a French
marriage, and support on the most liberal scale to Orange, composed
the policy which it was imperative for England to adopt. Everything
was pointing to a Huguenot ascendency in France; Marguerite of Valois
was on the point of marrying young Henry of Navarre, head of the
Bourbons, and next in succession to the throne after the reigning
king’s brothers. To play fast and loose with the Alençon marriage would
alienate France; to play fast and loose with Orange would be to throw
him into the arms of France alienated from England. That Philip, seeing
England thus isolated, would cheerfully forgive and forget all that he
had suffered, for the sake of an unstable union with her, was almost
unthinkable. Yet the months went by, and the Ambassador could get no
guidance even from the sympathetic Burghley, who was as much in the
dark as ever as to Elizabeth’s real intentions.

But there was a factor in the situation of which on one had taken
full account; not Walsingham, nor Burghley, nor Elizabeth; not the
Huguenots; not Philip nor Alva. This was Catherine de Medici’s
overwhelming lust of personal power, and the passion of jealousy
accompanying it. She saw her ascendency over her son Charles IX.
slipping away and passing into the hands of Coligny and his associates.
For victory and vengeance, she prepared to commit, perhaps, the most
appalling crime in the annals of Christian Europe. Paris was crowded
with Huguenots gathered to celebrate the pact of amity, to be sealed
by the wedding of the Béarnais and the sister of the king. Stealthily
and swiftly the plans were laid, the plot organised, the preparations
completed. The wedding took place on August 18: three days later, an
unsuccessful attempt was made to murder Coligny. It may be that if the
assassin had killed the Admiral, the huge tragedy which followed would
have been averted; as it was, hours before the sun of St. Bartholomew’s
day (August 24) had risen, the floodgates had been opened, and the
streets of Paris were running red with rivers of Huguenot blood.
During the following days, like scenes were being enacted through the
provinces.

For a moment Europe stood breathless, aghast. Whatever this appalling
thing meant, it seemed at least an assured portent of developments
undreamed of; probably a vast, all-embracing, Catholic conspiracy.
England sprang to arms, ready to stand at bay against the united forces
of France and Spain. If there was to be a life-and-death struggle
between the religions, she would fight to the last gasp. The Englishmen
in the French capital had been safeguarded on the night of the
massacre, but it was some little time before they could be sure that
their turn was not still to come. Yet Walsingham in Paris bore himself
with the same lofty sternness that the English Queen and her Council
displayed to the French Ambassador in London. It soon became evident
that Catherine was frightened at what she had done; that her one desire
was to minimise it, to declare that matters had never been intended
to go so far, to shelter behind the plea that the victims had been on
the verge of effecting a bloody _coup d’état_ and the counter-stroke
had only been dealt in self-defence. Walsingham’s reply was in terms
of courteous but scathing incredulity. The Queen-Mother tried to
win him over by declaring that Coligny had warned Anjou against the
machinations of England; he answered that the Admiral had acted therein
as a loyal Frenchman.

The diplomatic fabric had collapsed, but at least there was no question
of France holding Elizabeth to blame for the rupture; nor was there any
question of Catherine turning to a junction with Spain. The Huguenots
now were at bay; there would be work enough before they were either
crushed or pacified; while the slaughter of their leaders had made
the Guises more dangerous than ever. On the other hand, there could
be no joint action on behalf of Orange. France had ruled herself out.
Walsingham would still have stood boldly for “the Religion,” but
the Queen and Burghley were not equally ready to fling themselves
single-handed into the struggle on behalf of the Netherlands. The
Spaniards deemed the opportunity a good one for seeking reconciliation
with England. A more politic and less bloodthirsty Governor was
dispatched to the Low Countries to take the place of Alva, who by his
own desire was recalled. Walsingham went back to England, and for some
time to come Philip and Elizabeth were engaged in an elaborate if
insincere ostentation of amicable intentions.


IV

ENTANGLEMENTS

Burghley as Secretary had been so heavily worked that he was in
danger of breaking down; to prevent such a catastrophe, he was made
Lord Treasurer, Walsingham on his return to England being appointed
joint Secretary of State with Sir Thomas Smith. Leicester continued
to be Burghley’s chief rival with Elizabeth on the Council, owing to
his personal favour with her; and his political line was the same as
Walsingham’s, though the Secretary supplied the brains. Walsingham was
neither the rival nor the follower of either; it was never in his mind
to supplant Burghley either himself or by Leicester; but his counsels
and those of the Lord Treasurer were often in disagreement in so far as
his Protestantism was more energetic, and as he had no sympathy with
the idea of amity with Spain, being thoroughly convinced of Philip’s
fundamental hostility to England as a Protestant Power.

For some years the Protestant policy was out of court so far as Spain
and the Netherlands were concerned; the comparative moderation of the
new Governor, Requesens, giving plausibility to the hope that a _modus
vivendi_ might be arrived at--that Philip’s maximum of concession
and Orange’s minimum of demand might prove capable of adjustment.
In Scotland, however, Walsingham and Burghley both recognised the
necessity of maintaining friendly relations with the capable but
sinister Regent, the Earl of Morton. It was impossible to ignore
the danger of a reconstruction of parties there, which might again
result in French intervention being invited; a consummation equally
abhorrent to the Treasurer and the Secretary. Elizabeth’s parsimony
here proved too strong for her policy. Burghley and Walsingham both
believed that liberal but judicious expenditure would prove economical
in the long run. But the Queen would not relax the purse-strings; the
unrest of Scotland continued to be a thorn in her side, and to be also
a perpetual strain on the anxiety of her ministers and a drain on her
Exchequer.

Requesens died in 1576; before his successor, Don John, arrived, the
Spanish soldiery--whose pay was in arrear--got completely out of
hand; and the autumn saw the hideous butchery in Antwerp known as
the “Spanish Fury.” The whole of the provinces--Catholic as well as
Protestant--were united thereby in a solid demand for the restoration
of their old constitutional privileges, and the withdrawal of Spanish
troops; and in a flat refusal to admit the new Governor or recognise
his government, until their main demands were conceded. Don John made
provisional terms and was admitted in the spring following; but he
was known to be harbouring audacious designs against England, the
Hollanders suspected his good faith, and the old state of serious
tension was renewed. Drake was planning his great voyage, to the entire
satisfaction of the anti-Spanish party--but with an obvious certainty
of giving extreme offence to Philip, which caused them to make a vain
attempt to keep the thing secret from Burghley; while Elizabeth--who
liked playing with fire and was also greedy for money--made her own
bargain with the adventurer. Thus, in 1578 a curious state of affairs
arose. Philip, jealous of his half-brother, and still extremely anxious
to avoid a rupture with England, once more accredited an ambassador
to the English Court, Bernardino de Mendoza, whose business was to be
conciliation; Elizabeth’s Council swayed to the views of Walsingham and
Leicester, while Burghley seemed to be outweighted. The Queen started
on one of her most exasperating pieces of political jugglery, snubbing
Orange on the one hand, and on the other reviving the Alençon marriage
project; while Alençon himself was now posing as a would-be figure-head
for the Huguenots, and at odds with his brother Henry III., who had
succeeded Charles IX. two years after St. Bartholomew.

To his own intense disgust, Walsingham was despatched to the
Netherlands on the most thoroughly uncongenial task that could be
conceived: one, moreover, which it would have been quite impossible
for him to accomplish even if his heart had been in it. He was to urge
the Protestant States to accept the Spanish terms, which would have
deprived them of the exercise of their religion; he was to refuse
the promised issue of the bonds on which they were relying for the
sinews of war; in effect, he was to represent England in what he
himself looked upon as an act of betrayal. Of course, the mission
was a failure. Betrayed or not, Orange and his party would never
accept the Spanish terms; they would rather take the risk of a French
Protectorate, or die fighting. Walsingham loathed the job, and wrote
home in very bitter terms of the shame the whole of the proceedings
were bringing on the name of England. The only glimmer of satisfaction
he extracted from it was in the retraction of the monstrous breach of
faith about the bonds. It was bad enough that Elizabeth’s name should
be made a by-word for falsehood; it was only less bad that France,
instead of England, should become for her own ends the friend and
protector of the Low Countries; it was sickening that he, of all men,
should be made the agent of such perfidy, held personally responsible
for it abroad, and rewarded by his mistress with abuse because it
failed. “It is given out,” he wrote, “that we shall be hanged on our
return, so ill have we behaved ourselves here: I hope we shall enjoy
our ordinary trial--my Lord Cobham [his colleague] to be tried by his
peers, and myself by a jury of Middlesex.... If I may conveniently, I
mean, with the leave of God, to convey myself off from the stage and to
become a looker-on.”

Elizabeth, however, was far too keenly alive to his value to allow him
to become a looker-on; nor could Burghley have spared him, however
their views might differ on some points. The Queen might ignore his
advice, but she relied on his penetration and his loyalty, and was more
afraid of his righteous indignation than of the Lord Treasurer’s sober
disapprobation. Neither minister would countenance what they accounted
perfidy, and in act she never in the long run degraded her honour as
much as she repeatedly threatened to do. Both of them spoke their
minds. She knew they were in the right; she resisted, abused, flouted,
defied them; but she always yielded enough, and in time, to save some
shreds of credit.

The death of Don John about the end of September was followed by the
appointment of Alexander of Parma, a statesman and soldier of the
first rank, as his successor; who at the outset skilfully severed the
union between the northern or Protestant and the southern or Catholic
provinces. If Burghley could have had his own way untrammelled, he
would have dealt straightforwardly with Orange, giving him support
enough to keep him from calling in France, and still hoping to bring
about an accommodation with Parma possible of acceptance by both
parties. Neither he nor Walsingham now had any belief in joint action
with France, in which their confidence had been permanently blotted
out by the Paris massacre. Neither of them, therefore, saw good in the
Alençon marriage as a genuine project, while both saw infinite danger
in merely playing with it. They differed, as it would seem, only as to
the length they were prepared to go in helping Orange, Burghley drawing
the line at the point where he thought Philip might be driven into a
declaration of open war, while the Secretary would have taken bigger
risks, accepting open war if Philip chose. The Queen’s object was the
same as Burghley’s, but she elected, according to her habit, to seek
it not by straightforward, but by crooked, courses. She would give
Orange the minimum of help, but she would, by playing with Alençon,
either keep France out of it, or else embroil France and Spain, keeping
herself out of it till she could strike in as arbiter. To do which, she
had to induce every one to believe that she probably meant marrying,
while trusting to her own ingenuity and the chapter of accidents to
effect, if the worst came to the worst, an escape not too ruinously
ignominious. If she really did know what she wanted, it was more than
any of her Council did, and she drove them almost to despair.

So the juggling went on; the Queen blew hot and cold with Alençon,
and tried to inveigle France into a league without a marriage; the
French tried to get the marriage secured as preliminary to a league.
Drake came home, his ship loaded with spoils; but the remonstrances
of Mendoza were met by complaints of the assistance given by Spain
to the Desmond rebellion in Ireland. Walsingham was flatly opposing
the marriage, and the Puritan element in the country at least was
with him to a man. Parsons and Campion, and the Jesuit propaganda,
had set Puritans and Catholics alike in a ferment. In the summer of
1581 Alençon was still dangling, France was still waiting to have
the marriage question settled, Philip had just annexed Portugal, and
Burghley himself was despairing of a peaceful outcome.

Under these circumstances, Elizabeth again chose to despatch Walsingham
on an embassy to Paris. He was to get the Queen out of the marriage
without upsetting the French. He was to get France to espouse the
cause of Orange, while England was only to render secret pecuniary
aid. Whether, in the last resort, the Queen would accede to the
marriage for the sake of a secret league, or would accede to an open
league to escape the marriage, or would positively on no condition
have either marriage or open league, or would still keep the marriage
unaccomplished but unrejected if she could, Walsingham did not know;
for whatever instructions he received were liable to be contradicted
in twenty-four hours. He was to extract his mistress from the tangle
in which she had involved herself, and might understand that whatever
means he found for doing so would be angrily condemned.

Naturally, he found the situation almost impossible. The King and the
Queen-Mother would make an open league and let the marriage go; of
that, he felt satisfied. But they would not have an undeclared league,
nor commit themselves at any price to any war in the Low Countries,
if there were any possible loophole for Elizabeth to back out of
supporting them. She must be so committed that she could not back out.
The suspicion that she was only dallying both with the marriage and the
league could only be got rid of by the most straightforward dealing,
and if she would not listen to advice there was the gravest danger
that she would find France, Spain, and Scotland all united against
her. He wrote in very plain terms that if she would not make up her
mind to a liberal expenditure, and convince her neighbours that she
had done so, ruin threatened. The instructions from England continued
to be evasive, non-committal. The personal correspondence between
Burghley and Walsingham is particularly interesting, as showing the
complete confidence between them, the loyalty with which the Treasurer
fought the Secretary’s battles with the Queen, though in vain, and
Walsingham’s entire frankness to him.

“Sorry I am,” he writes, “to see her Majesty so apt to take offence
against me, which falleth not out contrary to my expectation, and
therefore I did protest unto her, after it had pleased her to make
choice of me to employ me this way, that I should repute it a greater
favour to be committed to the Tower, unless her Majesty may grow more
certain in her resolutions there.” Twelve days later he fairly exploded
in a letter to the Queen herself. He told her point-blank that she
had already lost Scotland, and was like enough to lose England too,
by her parsimony, and finished up--“If this sparing and improvident
course be held still, the mischiefs approaching being so apparent as
they are, I conclude therefore ... that no one that serveth in place
of a Counciller, that either weigheth his own credit, or carrieth that
sound affection to your Majestie as he ought to do, that would not wish
himself in the farthest part of Ethiopia, rather than enjoy the fairest
palace in England. The Lord God therefore direct your Majestie’s heart
to take that way of councel that may be most for your honour and
safety.”

Nothing came of the embassy; not even the ruin foretold by Walsingham.
The wonderful Queen managed somehow to keep Alençon dangling; and while
he dangled there would be no decisive breach with France. In November
he was in England again. She promised to marry him, kissed him, and a
few weeks later told Burghley that she would not marry the man on any
terms. The ministers, of course, could see nothing possible but an
irreconcilable quarrel with France over the affair sooner or later;
and again Burghley’s efforts were directed to pacifying Mendoza, and
Walsingham’s to forcing Elizabeth into openly supporting Orange. In the
Council Burghley was practically alone; yet Walsingham could not effect
his object. The impending avalanche did not fall--and then Alençon in
effect committed suicide by trying to play the traitor and failing
ignominiously to carry out his plot; thereby making himself obviously
and hopelessly impossible. The rupture with France on that score was
averted. His death a year later, in 1584, made Henry of Navarre actual
heir presumptive to the crown of France; and then the question of
the succession became, and remained, so critical that all parties in
France were too hotly engaged in their own contests to take effective
part in quarrels beyond their borders. Orange was assassinated; the
Throgmorton plot had convinced Burghley himself that the duel with
Spain was inevitable; and in 1585 Parma’s skill brought affairs in the
Netherlands to a point at which nothing but the armed intervention
of England could apparently save the revolted provinces from utter
destruction. Before the end of the year Elizabeth was in open league
with them. At last, circumstances had compelled her officially to
commit herself to Walsingham’s policy, though even now she could not
bring herself to resign either her systematic penuriousness or her
systematic vacillation.


V

DETECTIVE METHODS

Walsingham has hitherto appeared in the character of a foreign minister
or ambassador with two main functions--to gauge the intentions
of foreign courts, and to carry out a policy with which he was
dissatisfied by methods which he abominated: the ally of Leicester in
the policy he advocated, the ally of Burghley in his moral attitude
towards the Queen. She and Burghley were at one in the knowledge that
she must preserve Continental Protestantism from sheer destruction, and
in the determination to limit their help, so long as it was possible to
do so, in such wise as to avoid war with Spain. Since 1577 Walsingham
had been opposed to that limitation; in 1584 Burghley himself was
relinquishing it with reluctance, and with the persistent hope that a
reconciliation might again become possible.

As a diplomatist, Sir Francis appears to have possessed in a high
degree the quality of impenetrability, the precision of veracity which
has the effect of _suppressio veri_ or of _suggestio falsi_, misleading
of set purpose but without deviation from formal truth. The ethics of
the twentieth century have not yet learnt to condemn skilful deception
in this kind, at any rate where it is not directed to personal ends.
But the means which, in other capacities than that of an ambassador,
Walsingham employed for obtaining information, were not always such
as would be ventured on to-day by a politician who was unwilling to
be called unscrupulous. Yet they were means which--so far as they can
with certainty be attributed to him--would have been unhesitatingly
sanctioned by almost every contemporary.

It has to be borne in mind, in the first place, that throughout the
Elizabethan period every country in Europe was thick with plots, with
the political intention of a violent _coup d’état_, or the religious
intention of removing an obnoxious personality. While Elizabeth was on
the throne the list of successful assassinations included those of two
Dukes of Guise, a King of France, the Prince of Orange, Darnley, Moray,
and the victims of St. Bartholomew. Attempts which only just failed
were made on Orange and Coligny. There were at least three plots--those
known by the names of Ridolfi, Throgmorton, and Babington--in favour
of Mary Stewart, and involving the assassination of Elizabeth, in
which Philip, or some of his ministers, or the Guises, or the Pope, or
Cardinal Allen, were implicated, besides minor ones. Rizzio’s murder
was political; and Burghley’s life was the object of a conspiracy.
These are merely a few conspicuous instances out of a very long roll.
The ingenuity of zealots, on either side, who honestly believed that
in slaying a leader of heretics or of persecutors they were rendering
acceptable service to the Almighty, was backed by the unscrupulousness
of politicians, who might not, indeed, themselves be prepared to stab
or poison, but were quite ready to make use of those who would do
so. In England especially there were vast interests involved in the
removal of Elizabeth, whose legitimate heir was, beyond all question,
the Catholic Queen of Scots. Plots merely directed against the Queen’s
person were serious enough; but they might be combined with schemes for
invasion or concerted insurrection, like the revolt of the northern
Earls. The plotters were perfectly unscrupulous. Nothing could be more
certain than that, so long as the Queen of Scots was alive and in
captivity, there would be a series of conspiracies, with or without
her connivance, having it as their object to place her on the throne
of England. And we must remember, further, that, to intensify the
situation, a Papal Bull had declared that while it was not incumbent
upon Catholics in England actively to hatch treason against the Queen
of England, it was incumbent on them to countenance, and meritorious to
take part in it.

With the tremendous issues at stake, both national and religious, with
the forces engaged in setting conspiracy in motion or in encouraging
it, with the untrammelled character of its operations, the nature
of the fight was obviously very different from anything with which
modern statesmen have to deal. Yet where active secret societies
are in existence, the police methods of modern Governments are the
police methods of Walsingham. The spy, the paid informer, the _agent
provocateur_, play the same part now as in the sixteenth century. It
was in the risks for a Spanish ambassador or agent that his secretary,
or some other person standing to him in a confidential relation, might
be in the pay of the English Secretary of State. Any influential person
suspected of Catholic leanings might wake up one morning to find that
a tolerably complete copy of his correspondence was in Walsingham’s
hands. A plot, big or small, might progress merrily while the plotters
hugged themselves on their skill and secrecy--till the psychological
moment arrived for dropping the mask, and they found that they had
merely been drawn into a carefully prepared trap.

Walsingham had no qualms about employing liars, perjurers, the basest
kind of scoundrels in this business. When he had caught his culprits
he quite deliberately applied the rack and other forms of torture to
extract evidence. He would have argued that the Queen’s enemies had
chosen their own method of fighting, and it was legitimate to meet them
with their own weapons--as Clive argued in the case of Omichund; that,
in fact, it was only by the use of their own weapons that he could make
sure of defeating them. Also he did not originate the system--espionage
and the rack were in full play when his foot was only on the lowest
rung of the ladder. Also, these methods were not employed vindictively,
but with the single object of obtaining true information by which
treasonous designs might be frustrated. Also, in acting as he did, he
did not violate the public conscience--or his own, with its rigid Old
Testament limitations.

But there is one case in which he is charged with having gone farther.

It would be difficult to find any even approximate parallel to the
position of Mary Stewart in England. Whatever her own attitude might
be, she was the inevitable centre of Catholic plots of the most
far-reaching order. While she lived, the throne of Elizabeth and the
triumph of the Reformation in England could never be secure. She was
held captive on no legitimate ground, but solely because her title to
the English throne was so strong that the Queen could not afford to
set her at liberty. In plain terms, the national security required
her death, but unless she could be convicted of plotting against the
life of Elizabeth, there was no legitimate ground for putting her to
death. The eighth Henry would have made short work with her; there
was no European sovereign who would not have made short work with any
dangerous pretender to his crown who lay completely in his power. Yet
even the Throgmorton conspiracy was not turned to her destruction;
Elizabeth had her own reasons for preferring to keep her captive alive.
But the Throgmorton revelations, with the assassination of Orange, the
death of Alençon, the approach of the Spanish crisis, and the growing
certainty that Mary’s son would not take her place as the figure-head
for Catholic conspiracies, went far to cancel Elizabeth’s reasons. To
Walsingham, alike as patriot and protestant, the death of Mary had long
been about the most desirable event that could occur; and now he saw
his way to compass it--to inveigle her within reach of the law.

He reckoned it as a certainty that if she found herself able to
communicate with her partisans undetected, she would soon enough get
involved in some plot of a character which would justify her doom
in the eyes of the world. A supposed adherent of hers, a Jesuit,
devised means of communicating with her and of passing her secret
correspondence in and out of Chartley Manor. She fell into the trap:
the supposed adherent was Walsingham’s agent. Every letter was opened
and copied. A plot was soon on foot for her liberation, an invasion,
and the deposition of Elizabeth, whose assassination by Anthony
Babington was part of the scheme. From Walsingham’s point of view, the
vital point was to get her definitely implicated in Babington’s part of
the conspiracy. At last, Philips, the decipherer of the correspondence,
produced a letter which was decisive. Then Walsingham struck. The
bubble burst; Mary was tried and condemned.

Now an issue appears between Walsingham and Mary. The Scots Queen
admitted participation in the plot up to a certain point: she denied
_in toto_ knowledge of the intended assassination. Apart from certain
phrases in one letter, it cannot be conclusively shown that she was
lying. The conditions made it possible that she never wrote those
incriminating phrases; that they were forged. Did Walsingham fabricate
that evidence in order that Mary might be prevented from escaping what
he regarded as her just and necessary doom, on a technical plea? Did
Philips forge it and persuade him that it was genuine? Or was it in
fact genuine? Mendoza believed that Mary was in the secret, but Mendoza
may have been under a misapprehension. No one will ever be able to
answer that riddle decisively. But the form of Walsingham’s denial,
when the imputation of forgery was made in court, is worth noting. “As
a private person, I have done nothing unbecoming an honest man, nor,
as I bear the place of a public person have I done anything unworthy
my place.” If Walsingham did fabricate the evidence, he did it with
a clear conscience; that is, with an honest conviction that he was
discharging a duty; that he was “doing nothing unworthy his place.” The
thing is perfectly conceivable. No one will deny that John Knox was a
conscientious man; but John Knox justified assassination. Walsingham
himself thought it permissible in certain circumstances. But the case
is not proved one way or the other. The twist in his rigid conscience
may not have been crooked enough for that. Yet the whole business of
deliberately making arrangements to facilitate plotting on his victim’s
part is hardly on a different plane. The point of interest lies in the
fact that under sixteenth-century conditions such acts were committed
and were sanctioned without compunction not only by men without
conscience, or of careless conscience, or of conventional or adaptable
conscience, but by the very men who held hardest to moral ideals: men
whose serious purpose was to do all to the glory of God.


VI

THE END

For all her confidence in and dependence on Walsingham, the Secretary
was never _persona grata_ with Elizabeth. She abused him more roundly
and more frequently than any other member of her Council. If an
opportunity offered of setting him a task which was utterly against
the grain, she would not let it go; and she liked him none the better
for his share in making her responsible for the death of Queen Mary.
In that, as in passing from covert to overt war with Spain, she was
compelled to follow his policy; but she did not increase her favour
to him and his allies, and she followed the policy with marked
ill-will. Nothing could avert a desperate conflict, yet she continued
to the last to drive the war-party half-frantic by parsimony, by
issuing impracticable orders, by imposing paralysing restrictions, by
temporising with Parma and threatening to betray her allies. And when
the great Armada was triumphantly shattered by English seamen, and
thereafter overwhelmed by the winds and the waves, and Drake would have
delivered a still more fatal blow by rending Portugal from Philip, she
carefully tied the Admiral up with instructions which doomed the Lisbon
expedition to fruitlessness and its great organiser to discredit and
practical retirement.

If Walsingham lived to see England freed from the nightmare of Mary
Stewart, and on a palpable equality with Spain, the accession of the
leader of “the Religion” in France to the throne, if not as yet to
the rulership, of that country, and the rise of a worthy successor to
William the Silent in the person of Maurice of Nassau, yet his last
years were full enough of bitterness. He had striven devotedly with
a single eye to the welfare of his country, so loyally and with such
absence of self-seeking that he had beggared himself in the process.
His services--invaluable yet unwelcome--were requited by chill
disfavour; the assistance to which gratitude and justice should have
entitled him was denied, since lavish bounty to Walter Raleigh suited
the Queen’s humour better at the time; and the statesman who with
Burghley had done most, for twenty years, for the honour and the safety
of England, died so poor that he was buried quietly and privately--at
his own desire--that his heirs might be spared the charges of a costly
funeral. Whether he was in alliance with Burghley, or in occasional
antagonism to the policy of his great colleague, the personal
friendship and fidelity of the two to each other remained unbroken
to the end. That is almost the only pleasing reflection to which his
closing years give rise. For the rest, he passed from the world, one
more example of the ingratitude of princes.




SIR WALTER RALEIGH


I

CHARACTER

In his virtues and in his faults, in his brilliance and in his
limitations, in his greatness and in his defects, Walter Raleigh is
the very type of Elizabeth’s England. Like Robert Cecil, Spenser,
and Sidney, he was a child when the great queen ascended the throne;
like Shakespeare and Bacon, he had not passed the full vigour of
manhood when she died. He was a year older than Henry of Navarre, whom
he outlived by eight years. Walsingham was a grown man and William
Cecil a Secretary of State before any one of this younger group was
born. All of them were young men still when the crisis of Elizabeth’s
reign was reached and the Armada was dispersed. The older generation
raised England from weakness to strength; the younger saw her strength
made patent to the world. The older generation maintained her on the
defensive; it was the part of the younger to assert her primacy in
every field of endeavour.

Of this younger generation, Raleigh stands out as the typical
representative. In an age of men of action, he was one of the greatest
of the men of action. In one of the two greatest ages of English
poetry he was acclaimed as one of their peers by the poets. In the age
which saw the creation of English prose, he was one of the masters
of prose. The military world and the naval world were developing new
theories of strategy and tactics; in both fields he was a first-rate
authority and a brilliant performer. The expansion of Spain and
Portugal had brought new political conceptions into being; we owe
the conception of Greater Britain and all the first stubborn efforts
to realise it to the genius of Sir Walter. In a day of brilliant
courtiers, none was more brilliant than he; and in the day when Bacon
was formulating anew the principles of scientific inquiry, Raleigh was
incidentally an ardent experimentalist. In every field his versatility
was exercised, and in every field his place was in the front rank.

[Illustration: _SIR WALTER RALEIGH_

_From the Painting by_ FEDERIGO ZUCCARO _in the National Portrait
Gallery_]

And yet perhaps--save in one thing--never quite in the first rank.
His literary achievement does not set him beside Shakespeare and
Spenser. Drake was a greater commander and John Davis a greater
seaman. By land he was never tested in a great command. His scientific
pursuits were merely a parergon. As a statesman he never achieved the
control of England’s destinies; wily Robert Cecil was the craftier
politician. But two things he did: he taught Englishmen that the might
of England lay in her fleets--not as the accident of a moment but as a
permanent principle; and he created the idea of a Britain beyond the
seas, struggled for it almost alone year after year with persistent
tenacity, through good report and evil report and failure--finally
died for it. He it was that sowed the seed; ours is the tree that
sprang from it.


II

RALEIGH’S RISE

Walter Raleigh was born in 1552, a year before Mary Tudor ascended
the English throne. He was of a Devon house; himself, one of a large
and composite family, for his mother, Katharine Champernoun, was his
father’s third wife, and was herself a widow with several children
when she married him. It must have counted for something for a small
boy to have had two such big half-brothers as Humphrey and Adrian
Gilbert, both dreamers and idealists, and one of them a by-no-means
contemptible man of action to boot. The child was six years old when
the great persecution was ended by Elizabeth’s accession, and for the
next ten years he had endless opportunities of listening with all his
ears to mariners’ tales of Eldorado and of the Spanish Inquisition,
and learning at least watermanship if not seamanship. In 1568 he went
up to Oxford, at the moment when Alva was goading the Netherlands into
open rebellion and France was on the verge of a fresh outbreak of the
Huguenot wars. Raleigh’s career as an undergraduate was interrupted.
He went off to France as a volunteer, to get his baptism of blood at
Jarnac in March, and to be present at Montcontour later in the year.

After that, his career for some while is not easy to trace. It looks
as if he had returned to Oxford, for his name was still on the list of
undergraduates at Oriel in 1572; but it is also said that he remained
in France for five years, and even that he was in Paris at the time of
the massacre. In 1575 he entered--_pro forma_--at the Middle Temple;
and two or three years later appears to have been in the field again,
fighting in the Low Countries under Sir John Norreys. The chances are
that he had had some further military practice in the interval between
1569 and 1578, in France or the Netherlands or both, especially as his
brother Humphrey Gilbert was in command of the English contingent at
Flushing and elsewhere for some while. In 1578 Gilbert sailed on his
first colonising venture, and young Walter was one of his captains;
but the expedition, after a collision with some Spaniards, was driven
back to Plymouth by weather. In 1580, Raleigh emerges definitely as a
captain in the army employed for the suppression of Desmond’s rebellion
in Ireland--in which capacity he was present at the capture of
Smerwick, and had the unsavoury business of superintending the massacre
of the garrison.

Raleigh remained in Ireland on duty for something over a year, till
the end of 1581. While there he accomplished sundry feats of arms
of a brilliant character, all being of the kind in which personal
daring and skill, and resourcefulness in emergency, are the leading
characteristics--deeds in which he was acting with only some very small
escort. It was very much in the nature--_mutatis mutandis_--of police
work among hostile frontier tribes in India to-day. The young soldier’s
ideas of Irish government were derived from Humphrey Gilbert, who, in
all other relations of life, was a noble-hearted generous Christian
gentleman, but in this particular relation was as perfectly ruthless as
Alva himself might have been. It is one of the puzzles of the period
that men who upheld elsewhere the highest standards of chivalry and
honour--men such as Sussex, Henry Sidney, Walter Devereux--adopted
towards the native Irish the attitude of the primitive Hebrew towards
the Canaanites, seeming to account the human population as if they were
an irredeemably pernicious species of wild beasts; and Raleigh was no
exception to the rule.

Immediately on his return to England he sprang into high favour with
Elizabeth, partly through his brilliant abilities, partly through the
personal fascination which no one could exercise better when he chose.
But this charm was accompanied by an insatiable ambition, pridefulness,
and fiery temper, which effectually prevented him from making any
attempt to conciliate rivalry or hostility, cut him off from his
natural alliance with the court section of the war-party, and rather
associated him with Burghley. Favourite as he was, and in some ways
influential with the Queen, he was never admitted by her into the Privy
Council, though he was knighted so early as 1584, and received numerous
and exceedingly substantial marks of the royal goodwill.

In fact, it would seem that his imagination carried his mind away from
the current problems of administration and policy to another field.
He was less occupied with the question how war with Spain might be
precipitated or deferred than with that of setting up a rival empire.
If, as is most probable, the conception was primarily that of his
brother Humphrey Gilbert, the younger man made it his own; and in these
years the attempt to establish a colony in North America absorbed his
best energies and enthusiasms. For Burghley, Spain was primarily the
European Power which--however interests might clash--was a necessary
counterpoise to France; for Walsingham, she was the aggressive enemy
of Protestantism; for Raleigh, she was the claimant to the New World,
whose rights might be and ought to be successfully challenged by
England. Thus, the first desired to avert conflict; the second was at
least ready to join issue at once, lest it should be too late; whereas,
from Raleigh’s point of view, the time when Spain and England should
grapple was a matter of comparative indifference, provided that when
it arrived England should be ready. But there was probably no man
in England--not Drake himself--in whose political creed fundamental
hostility to Spain was a more essential article.

There is, however, a curious story that in 1586 Raleigh was engaged
in Spanish negotiations on his own account, which negotiations had
as their object that he should take measures to hamper the English
preparations for war, himself selling a couple of ships to Spain; and
it appears to be implied that he was one of those young gentlemen
about the Queen’s person who were going to put through Babington’s
plot for her assassination. We may therefore recall the fact that in
the Ridolfi days John Hawkins had figured as an enemy of his Queen,
only thirsting to betray the fleet to Philip. Hawkins, of course, was
really working in collusion with Burghley, and the whole thing was a
trick. It need not surprise any one, therefore, if Raleigh played the
same game at this time, though on a smaller scale. It would be a matter
of course, then, that pains would be taken to give the Spaniards--and
their informants in England--the impression that Sir Walter was really
disaffected. As for Ballard and Babington, they were so completely in
the toils of Walsingham from the outset that Raleigh may very well have
actually been the Secretary’s accomplice in tricking them. Patriotism,
principle, and consistency apart, no one has ever accused him of
lacking intelligence, of which he would stand hopelessly convicted
if the suggested allegations were true. Moreover, a man with so many
enemies would not have escaped without being incriminated. The only
definitely known facts are that he was at this time in communication
with Spain, and that the Spaniards had an idea that he was
well-affected towards them. The only inference we can quite confidently
draw is that he was hoodwinking them, though nothing definite seems to
have resulted.

When the Armada was expected, Raleigh was Vice-Admiral of the West, and
was also one of the special Defence Commission. It was on the great
ship which he had himself designed, the _Ark Raleigh_, that Admiral
Howard hoisted his flag; but Raleigh was not one of the commanders in
the fleet. He had been largely occupied in organising the defences in
the West Country, and had been urgent in pressing the true strategical
policy of fighting and beating the Spaniard on the sea--of an offensive
naval war as the only true defensive war. But it is not quite certain
whether he even had any personal part in the Armada engagements at all;
though, on the whole, there is not sufficient ground for discarding
the common report that he joined the fleet as a volunteer after the
engagement off Portland. At that stage, all fears had passed that the
Spaniard might effect a landing in the western division of the channel,
where Raleigh was responsible for the arrangements for meeting the
invader. Until then, he had been bound to remain at his post on shore.
But now, not only did the English fleet know that it was a match for
the enemy, but, if chance should enable them to attempt a landing,
it would certainly not be in Raleigh’s district. So there is an _a
priori_ probability that, being free to join the ships, he would not
have missed the opportunity if it offered. There is no doubt, in any
case, that he fully understood and appreciated the tactics adopted--a
complete innovation in the methods of naval warfare--whether he did or
did not take actual part, as a gentleman-volunteer, in the manœuvres.

The great _débâcle_ initiated a new phase in the relations of Spain
to England and to Europe generally. The defeat, of course, was not
of itself a death-blow, though if victory had gone the other way--if
the English fleet had been in effect annihilated--an invasion under
Parma would have followed; and Parma was the best general living,
while the whole number of Englishmen who had any real experience of
military service was small. But hitherto, wherever the Spaniards went,
afloat or ashore, they had the prestige of success; now at a single
blow the prestige passed from Spain to England--the theory of Spanish
invincibility was shattered. The change had no less effect on Spain’s
enemies on the Continent than in England, where for years past the
seamen at least had been in the habit of taking for granted that they
understood the art of fighting on the sea infinitely better than their
antagonists. Now, however, the landsmen and the men of peace had had
ocular demonstration of what the sailors had long been affirming as the
conclusion from their own practical experience. England, hitherto on
the defensive, was converted into the attacking power, and was filled
with the spirit of aggression.


III

VIRGINIA

Between his seventeenth and his thirtieth years, Raleigh was completing
his education as a soldier by his experiences in varied fields from
Jarnac to Munster--sandwiching in, as it would appear, some residence
at Oxford, and some in London as a nominal student of the law; not
actually becoming a courtier but making his first _entrée_ among
the associates of the court. In his thirtieth year he returned
from Ireland to London, with a reputation as a dashing officer, and
immediately made his way into the good graces of the Maiden Queen
who, already verging on fifty, was demanding with increased instead
of diminished avidity the amorous adulation of those who would find
favour in her eyes. Raleigh made love to her on the recognised lines;
with distinguished success, also on the recognised lines; to his own
profit, and the extreme annoyance of the Leicesters and Hattons. The
famous story of the cloak may or may not be true--it rests only on
the authority of that chronicler whom every self-respecting author
is obliged to refer to as “old Fuller”--but it is one of those
traditions which, like King Alfred’s cakes and George Washington’s
little hatchet, can never be surrendered. In these years there are
tales of Hatton’s jealousy; records of appeals to the favourite to
intervene now on behalf of Burghley, now of Leicester, to mitigate
the royal displeasure; rumours, such as may have been concocted by
spite, of not over-scrupulous methods employed in the pursuit of
personal aggrandisement. Beside these stories of court-gossip and
intrigue are those of his association with Bohemian literary circles,
of his originating the meetings at the Mermaid, of his friendship with
Marlowe, and his reputed “atheism”--a quite incredible, if by no means
surprising, charge against a man whose speculations were probably
as bold and unconventional in the field of religion as in those of
political, naval, and military theory. But assuredly the author of the
“History of the World” was no atheist.

But during these years, between 1582 and 1588, he was something more
than the brilliant courtier, keen-witted humanist, and active member of
the Defence Commission--he was the pioneer of colonial expansion.

Humphrey Gilbert was thirteen years older than his half-brother, whose
hero he would seem to have been, not undeservedly, in Raleigh’s younger
days. Of brilliant attainments, the bravest of the brave, intensely
religious, an idealist and dreamer, he was a kind of incarnation of
Arthurian knighthood; for the very mercilessness he displayed in
Ireland was by no means the outcome of inhumanity but of a fixed belief
that the Irish ought to be accounted not as human beings but as beasts
of prey. Raleigh himself was hardly more than a boy when his brother
was already fixing his thoughts on the colonisation of North America
and the discovery of the North West Passage. It cannot therefore be
claimed for Sir Walter that he actually originated the Colonial idea,
which was Gilbert’s; but he entered into it from the first and made it
his own; while Gilbert lived, they worked for it together; and when the
Atlantic billows swallowed up Sir Humphrey, it was to Raleigh that his
mantle passed undisputed.

About the time that the young man was entered at the Temple, Sir
Humphrey was at work on the treatise “to prove a passage by the North
West to Cathay and the East Indies,” which was published in 1576 by
Gascoign. In 1578 he obtained a charter authorising what he had already
been petitioning for four years earlier, an expedition to discover
and take possession of unknown lands--the charter extending over six
years. We have already noted Raleigh’s participation in the first
expedition, which put to sea late in 1579 but was obliged to return
to port with nothing accomplished. In 1583 the second expedition
sailed; but this time Raleigh, though he had embarked everything he
could in the venture, was at the last moment peremptorily forbidden
to accompany it in person by his exigent mistress. Quite definitely,
the purpose of the expedition was not to hunt for precious metals but
to establish a permanent agricultural settlement. Incidentally, it is
to be noted that Walsingham was active in furthering the project. The
expedition took formal possession of Newfoundland, but this was not its
actual destination. Disasters overtook it, and Gilbert finding himself
compelled for the time to abandon the design, sailed for England.
On the course of the voyage, the little _Squirrel_, in which he was
sailing, went down in a storm with all hands on board. Raleigh was
left to struggle single-handed for the carrying out of his brother’s
conception.

Now begins the story of Raleigh’s persistent effort at the colonisation
of Virginia.

A fresh patent was issued to Sir Walter, who had just been knighted,
in March 1584--just two years after his first entry into Elizabeth’s
court. The first step was taken immediately--an exploring expedition,
which found its way to the island of Roanoak on the coast of what is
now Carolina, opened friendly intercourse with the natives, took formal
possession, and returned to report.

Raleigh was largely interested in the series of Arctic voyages
undertaken by John Davis during the three ensuing years: exploration
and discovery pure and simple had an attraction for him only less
powerful than colonisation; but it was to this that he devoted his
keenest energies, and on this that he poured out the wealth he was
acquiring. In the spring of 1585 his fleet sailed for Virginia, as the
new settlement was called, under the command of his kinsman, Richard
Grenville. Raleigh himself the Queen, of course, could not spare. The
open breach with Spain and the open alliance with Orange were now
approaching rapidly, and Grenville’s voyage seems to have been, in his
own eyes, directed more against Spaniards than with a single eye to the
colony. In due course, however, Roanoak was reached, and the settlement
established with Ralph Lane as governor; and Grenville came home.
Unluckily, the original friendly relations with the natives were upset;
the quarrel led the colonists into “making an example” of an Indian
village; and the Indians resolved to retaliate. Till their opportunity
should come, they merely made things as difficult as they could for the
Englishman. A relief-expedition had been promised for the following
Easter. It did not appear; but Drake did, with the fleet which had just
been employed in sacking Cartagena. The settlers resolved to throw up
their attempt, and returned to England with Drake. A few days after
they had sailed, the delayed relief party under Grenville arrived to
find the settlement abandoned. Fifteen volunteers were now left behind,
to keep the place in occupation; but when a new band of settlers with
a new governor arrived in the following spring (1587), they found
that the little garrison had been massacred. The party set about
establishing a settlement once more; but under the existing conditions
they induced John White, the governor, to return himself to England to
bring fresh supplies and reinforcements.

This was the year in which the Armada ought to have sailed against
England; but Drake’s successful raid on the harbour of Cadiz deferred
the invasion for a year. In the meantime, however, it was a matter
of extreme difficulty to get permission for any ship to leave an
English port. The demands of the coming duel were paramount. A couple
of relief vessels with White were hardly allowed to sail; and these
returned without reaching the colony. Again, the next year there was
an expedition, but it found Roanoak deserted, and learned that the
settlers had taken up fresh quarters. But neither did it discover them,
nor did any one of the search expeditions which Raleigh subsequently
despatched one after another.

He had spent £40,000--the equivalent of something like five times that
sum at the present day. For a dozen years his ships sailed--sometimes
with fresh settlers, sometimes with stores only; to meet only with
disappointment--often with nothing but reports that the bones of the
last party left behind were bleaching in some undiscovered spot.
Half of the pioneers themselves were ready to turn back, abandoning
the adventure, as soon as they realised that their business was not
going to be picking up gold and silver. Men of Grenville’s type
enjoyed themselves thoroughly when they were boarding Spanish galleons
against immense odds, or engaged in any other form of dare-devilry; a
different type was required to settle down to a stubborn fight with
Nature, and found rural or commercial communities. The necessary type
was forthcoming in course of time, but it had not yet realised the
field that was open to it. As yet there were none to experiment, save
adventurers who wanted something quite other than North America had to
give. At last Raleigh felt that for a time, but only for a time, he
was beaten; that to obtain support he must have prospects to suggest,
at least, of gold mines and silver mines; and his next great venture
was in another region where the golden city of Manoa was fabled to
be hidden. But he never lost faith in his own ideal, or recanted his
prophecy that the northern Continent would yet be possessed and peopled
by men of his own race, that he would live to see Virginia an English
nation. His own experiment failed; yet he lived to see the beginnings
of fulfilment under other auspices, when again a colony of Virginia
received a charter in 1606--this time to establish and maintain herself
as the mother of the American people.


IV

AFTER THE ARMADA

The spirit of aggression engendered by the Armada was too strong for
Burghley and his mistress to oppose directly. Their object was to give
it such an outlet as would satisfy popular sentiment without ruining
Spain; and popular sentiment, as they saw, would find satisfaction in
a mere extension of the old raiding warfare upon Spanish commerce. The
danger, in their eyes, was that the control of operations might fall
into the hands of men who not only desired to annihilate Spain but
knew how to do it. Drake and Raleigh recognised in Spain the one Power
which stood in the way of a complete English dominion of the seas,
with everything that would mean: that dominion was already almost won,
and could be made good. But if Drake were discredited, Raleigh would
be unable to give their policy effect. This was duly brought about by
the manipulation from headquarters of the Lisbon expedition, which
caused it to fail of accomplishing its immediate object. Thereafter the
policy was indeed anti-Spanish, but on the lines advocated by Hawkins
and Essex (who may now be said to have taken the place occupied by
Leicester till his death in 1588), not by Raleigh and Drake.

The distinction between Raleigh’s political conceptions and those of
his contemporaries marks the transition of which he was conscious
and they were not. Their eyes were fixed upon Europe. Burghley’s
calculations were always directed to the preservation of a balance
of power on the Continent; he was afraid of France, and knew the
commercial value of the Burgundian alliance. The New World did not
appeal to him at all--a rivalry there would hardly have seemed to him
desirable. The ordinary Englishman, on the other hand, felt that Spain
had proved herself the enemy of his country and his creed, and in the
moment of victory his views were roughly summed up in two phrases--_vae
victis_; and, _the spoils for the victors_. He had no very definite
ideas as to the further results, though he might have the triumph of
“the Religion” over Popery in his mind. If he thought of the New World,
it was not as a land where he might make himself a new home, but as a
Tom Tiddler’s ground for bold adventurers. Raleigh saw the vision of
the boundless empire occupied by the men of his own race. There are
indications that if Walsingham had lived Raleigh would have stood less
alone; but Walsingham died, poor and in disfavour, in 1590.

Roughly speaking, then, for some years after the Armada the war party
at large predominated; maintaining the system of persistent warfare
on Spanish commerce, varied at intervals with more effective blows
such as the attack on the Bretagne forts held by the Spaniards (in
league with the Guises), and the great Cadiz expedition. In these moves
Raleigh’s voice and hand were heard and felt; but they were isolated
moves, not followed up--largely owing to the clever management of
the Cecils, in whom the Queen really placed her reliance. The war
party itself was ruled in effect by the young Earl of Essex, whose
personality was particularly obnoxious to the Cecils, while his policy
was comparatively acceptable to them. Essex, being desperately jealous
of Raleigh’s general favour with the Queen, Sir Walter was generally on
friendly terms with the Cecils; whereas anything but a very temporary
show of amity between the two Court rivals was entirely out of the
question. And whenever Essex had access to the Queen he had the better
of the contest. These controlling conditions make Raleigh’s career at
this time intelligible.

Both Raleigh and Essex accompanied the Lisbon expedition in 1589.
Raleigh was with Drake; Essex, who had joined in defiance of orders,
with the land force. The fleet was in no way responsible for the
failure, though the blame was carefully laid on Drake; Raleigh,
ostensibly at any rate, rather gained in favour with the Queen, who was
extremely angry with Essex. The Earl, however, recovered his ascendency
while his rival was in Ireland in this same year. Then came another
period of Raleigh’s ascendency. Essex married Philip Sidney’s widow,
thereby infuriating his mistress; and, when he had been forgiven, was
not kept at Court, but sent to command the English contingent in France
in support of the king, Henry IV.--who was warring for his throne
against the Guises, backed by Philip. Still, the raiding policy held
the field, and the naval operations of 1590 were conducted by Hawkins
and Frobisher. The Treasure fleet, against which it was directed, had
warning and did not sail into the trap, so that the expedition was
practically a failure. A similar expedition was planned for the next
year, in which Raleigh was to have sailed as Vice-Admiral, Lord Thomas
Howard being in command; but, Essex being in France, Elizabeth would
not spare him, and Grenville went instead, to meet his death in the
last famous fight of the _Revenge_. The next year, Raleigh and the Earl
of Cumberland had a great enterprise on hand; but, again, Raleigh was
ordered to turn back and resign his command to Frobisher.

At this time Sir Walter fell into complete disgrace at Court, partly
because he did not at first obey the Queen’s orders, partly because
of the discovery of his _liaison_ with Elizabeth Throgmorton, who
became his wife--whether he was already secretly married to her is a
matter of some doubt. He was placed in confinement, and wrote the most
outrageous letters to Robert Cecil anent the misery of being deprived
of the sunshine of the Royal presence; in the then conventional
form of adulation for Gloriana. He was more or less forgiven when
the ships under the command of his lieutenant, Borough, returned,
with a very rich prize, of the value whereof Elizabeth took one-half
for herself. Incidentally, the whole story of this enterprise shows
that Raleigh could make himself as popular with sailors as unpopular
elsewhere; for the crews nearly mutinied when they found he was to be
displaced by Frobisher; and after they landed, Robert Cecil was quite
perturbed at the discovery of their devotion to him, their wrath at his
imprisonment, and his influence over them when he was sent down to the
port to keep matters straight.

Raleigh was released, but he no longer basked in the sunshine of the
Virgin Queen’s favour, and lived away from the Court, spending much of
his time at his newly acquired estate of Sherborne. About this time
his rival, returned from France, was admitted to the Privy Council,
from which he himself was still excluded; but he became active in
Parliament, in private matters relating to his various estates, and in
planning his great expedition for the “discovery of Guiana”; while he
was also an energetic advocate of the policy of expelling the Spaniards
from Brittany, relying--in full accord with the school of Drake--on the
navy as England’s instrument for fighting her great foe. The persuasive
eloquence of his tongue would seem to have equalled the picturesque
force of his pen, which had been displayed in more than one pamphlet,
notably in his extremely vivid account of the great fight in which
his kinsman Grenville lost his life--where his narrative powers are
associated with a singularly telling rhetorical invective directed
against the Spaniards.

For a dozen years past, however, Raleigh had hardly put to sea in his
own person, or seen much fighting. In 1595 he reappears as emphatically
a man of action.


V

FAVOUR AND FALL

The Virginia project was for the time abandoned, since it had become
clear that no serviceable co-operation could be expected from any
quarter. If the establishment of a working colony in North America
was out of his power, Raleigh came to the conclusion that territorial
acquisitions on the southern continent might prove more attractive.
Rumour declared that the Peruvian Incas had set up in the interior
a new empire, known as Guiana, whose capital was the golden city of
Manoa; Spanish attempts to penetrate inland had failed. If England
established her sovereignty in the heart of South America, taking
possession of what was believed to be the richest country in the
world, the most short-sighted could see what a prospect was offered of
dominating her rival, in the field to which that rival laid exclusive
claim; and the most avaricious might anticipate opportunities of
accumulating enormous wealth.

So Raleigh organised his expedition for the exploration of the Orinoco
in 1595, taking command of it in person. The record of it we have
from his own pen. As a matter of course, he had sundry collisions
with the Spaniards, very much of his own seeking, capturing Berreo,
the Governor of Trinidad, from whom he extracted a certain amount of
information. Then he made his way some distance up the great river,
enduring many hardships, seeing many strange sights, and gathering
still more astonishing reports; collecting also samples of ore which
suggested the auriferous character of the district. It seems, however,
a somewhat curious omission on his part that he had sailed without
proper means either for mining or assaying. In all other respects he
proved himself an extremely competent explorer, in especial recognising
the necessity of cultivating--in contrast to the Spaniards--the
confidence and friendliness of the natives; carrying out his scheme,
not on the hypothesis of bringing home the maximum of loot, but of
preparing the way for the systematic entry of England into a great
inheritance. He was again doomed to disappointment. The Cecils at
this period were cooperating with him cautiously, but he could still
get no other support; the Queen was minded to participate royally in
profits, but she preferred to leave all the risks to others--and the
others preferred the immediate return from raids to any systematic and
laborious methods, however paying in the long run. Moreover, the credit
which Sir Walter gave to apparently authentic but fabulous tales of
Amazons and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders, brought
undeserved discredit on the explorer’s account of what he had actually
seen. In short, the result of his adventure seemed very likely to be,
that adventurers with very different methods would visit Guiana in
search of Eldorado; but the beginnings of an English Empire in America
were brought no nearer.

By this time Elizabeth was awaking to the fact that Spain’s power of
aggression on the seas had by no means disappeared; and Drake had once
more been called into counsel. In the winter of 1595, the great seaman
and his old colleague and rival John Hawkins were in joint command of
a new Panama expedition, in the course of which both of them died.
The Cadiz expedition next year was the fruit of the more efficient
policy which was being forced to the front by circumstances. General
reconciliation was the order of the day in England; the Cecils, the
Howards, Raleigh, and Essex were all on formal terms of alliance.
Philip was making great naval preparations, when an English force
appeared off Cadiz; Essex was the General, Effingham the Admiral; his
cousin, Lord Thomas Howard and Raleigh, were both on the War Council.
Effingham wished to land the soldiers and attack the town; Raleigh,
who had been absent from the Council of War, appeared in time to get
a hearing; the decision arrived at was reversed, and Raleigh in his
vessel headed the squadron as it sailed into Cadiz harbour. There is
no doubt that Sir Walter was the hero of the occasion, setting the
example of doing the right thing in the right way. The result was that
thirteen of Philip’s best warships were sunk or captured, a great fleet
of forty sail packed full of riches was taken or burnt, and Cadiz
itself was sacked completely and thoroughly, while the persons of the
inhabitants were protected and cared for with a most unaccustomed
generosity. Raleigh’s own narrative--he was badly wounded during the
engagement--gives the fullest account of the proceedings, but is in
the main substantiated by other evidence; and if he had no qualms about
asserting the merits of his own performance, he was also at pains
to emphasise with generous frankness the frank generosity displayed
towards him by his personal rival. In all the relations between him and
Essex, this is the pleasantest--one might almost say the only really
pleasing--episode.

At last Raleigh was restored to Court favour; but for a time a
superficial friendliness with Essex was maintained, and the pair were
again united with Lord Thomas Howard in the following year in what
was known as the Islands voyage: a futile performance, in which the
English fleet had the worst of luck in respect of weather, and Essex,
who was in supreme command, showed grave incompetence--which was
hardly unnatural, since he was quite inexperienced in naval warfare
and knew nothing whatever of naval strategy. At one stage Raleigh,
awaiting Essex off Fayal (in the Azores), with orders not to attack
till the whole force was assembled, found sufficient reason, after
some days’ delay, for effecting the capture of the place on his own
responsibility--to the extreme annoyance of Essex. The action was
executed with brilliant courage and success; but the Earl’s anger was
with difficulty appeased, and the old animosity between the rivals was
to a great extent revived by the incident.

For a time, however, Raleigh was not much at Court. But Essex, who was
popular with the mob, as the other was not, was jealous of every one,
and nearly every one was jealous of Essex. Old Lord Burghley died, and
a considerable part of the story of the Queen’s last years is really
the story of the crafty intriguing by which Robert Cecil first urged
Essex to the ruin on which he was ready enough to rush, and then laid
his mines for the destruction of Raleigh--while carefully avoiding the
odium in both cases. Essex, when in Ireland, acquired a fixed idea that
Sir Walter was the principal person whose machinations were compassing
his downfall; but there is little enough reason to suppose that he
had any one but himself to thank. The only effective machinations
were those of the people who covertly encouraged his own arrogance
and misconduct. Nevertheless, it is matter of regret that when Essex
fell, Raleigh--who had recently received insults from him--did take a
vindictive line, while Cecil was posing as the advocate of magnanimity.

A sketch such as this does not permit of an examination of the
intricate plottings that surrounded the old Queen as she was wearing
rapidly to her grave. Roughly speaking, the English Catholics outside
the country were zealous for the quite impossible succession of Philip
III. of Spain--a plan which did not appeal to the Catholics in England.
There were schemes for the succession of that monarch’s sister, which
found supporters only on the basis of her uniting the crowns of the
Netherlands and England, in independence of Spain. There were ideas of
marrying Arabella Stewart and Lord Beauchamp--each of whom had some
sort of title--with the object of preventing the accession of James
VI., whose claim on purely legitimist grounds was quite indisputable.
Cecil, satisfied that James was the winning candidate, made it his
business to convince that prince that his peaceful accession would be
entirely due to Cecil’s own masterly management, and that Raleigh in
particular was extremely antagonistic; while Raleigh himself was at no
pains to curry favour with the Scots king.

Scarcely was Elizabeth dead and James on the throne when a plot for
his removal and the substitution of Arabella was brought to light,
and Raleigh was charged with having sold himself to Spain and being a
principal agent in the conspiracy, which involved the introduction of
Spanish troops. The conduct of the trial was a monstrous perversion
of justice, and Raleigh was condemned as a traitor. Apart from the
inadequacy of the evidence and the palpable fact that it was full of
contradictions and of perjury, it remains incredible that Raleigh
should ever have seriously intended to support a Spanish domination.
It would not only have been a flat contradiction of his whole career,
a merely amazing folly in the man who in all England was the most
absolutely convinced of the rottenness of the power of Spain; there
was also no man alive who more thoroughly appreciated the historical
truth, that he who sells his own country to her enemies purchases
for himself not power and confidence but suspicion and contempt. The
part of Themistocles would not have attracted him. He might have been
capable of playing a selfish game; he was certainly not likely to play
a consciously unpatriotic one; but the game attributed to him by his
enemies would have been in his own eyes not only unpatriotic, but, from
the selfish point of view, egregiously stupid.


VI

CAPTIVE AND VICTIM

Raleigh was condemned to die as a traitor; but the sentence was not
carried out. Instead, he was relegated to the Tower, and was there
held a prisoner for twelve years--mainly occupied in scientific and
literary pursuits, varied by petitions for release. His chemical
experiments may be accounted as a hobby; but his writings would have
assured his fame had he possessed no other claim to recognition. They
range over the whole field of what the Greeks included under the term
“politics”--economics, the art of war, the art of government, political
institutions, as well as other subjects. The incidental discourses on
such matters, illustrated from the events _quorum pars magna fuerat_,
with his comments thereon, give the main permanent interest to his
“History of the World”--in itself a monument of such historical
learning as was available in his day. On every subject he touched he
wrote with a knowledge of facts and a penetrating perception of causes
which distinguish him as a political thinker of a high order; alive,
like Thomas More, to truths which had hardly won general recognition
two centuries after he was in his grave. He who in the great days had
been the intimate of Edmund Spenser was in the days of his captivity
on terms of friendship with Ben Jonson. He, too, wrote poetry, but
this was for him rather in the nature of an intellectual exercise or
accomplishment than of a creative order; little that can with certainty
be attributed to him has been handed down, though that little includes
lines (like “The Lie” and the sonnet to Spenser) which are immortal,
assuring him his place on the English Helicon. But his _magnum opus_
was that “History of the World” which King James condemned because it
spoke too “saucily” of the doings of princes, but which was ranked by
Oliver Cromwell next to his Bible.

Raleigh’s condemnation produced a curious effect. Hitherto, he had been
able to win the devotion of the few chosen intimates whom he accounted
his intellectual peers, and of the mariners who sailed under his
command, who adored him in much the same way and for the same reasons
as they adored Francis Drake. Among courtiers his open and aggressive
consciousness of intellectual superiority and his scornful attitude
made him intensely unpopular; and he was the pet aversion of the mob,
who had made a hero of Essex and regarded him as the Earl’s principal
enemy. Yet the sense that he was a victim of gross injustice, the
dignity and eloquence he displayed at his trial, the contrast between
this typical Elizabethan and the minions of the new Stewart Court,
brought about a revulsion of sentiment, and Raleigh in the Tower became
an object of admiration, and to Henry Prince of Wales of hero-worship.

A curious psychological study is afforded by Sir Walter’s letters when
he was lying under sentence of death. He condescended to appeal to the
king for mercy in terms which can only be called abject; yet the ink
was scarcely dry when he was writing to his wife with tender affection
and beautiful dignity. The conclusion afforded by a comparison of
the documents is that his personal attitude towards death was that
expressed in the letter to his wife, but that for the sake of his
family he felt bound to appeal for life, and the only form of appeal
from which anything might be hoped must be couched in that style of
pitiful self-abasement and fulsome flattery which he adopted--and by
which he felt himself degraded.

While Robert Cecil lived there was never much hope of liberty for Sir
Walter, who yet seems never to have realised that his old friend and
colleague was, under the surface, his most determined enemy. But the
prisoner, though now advanced in years--he was already fifty-one at the
time of the trial--never ceased to dream of Eldorado, and to petition
for liberty in order to make one more expedition to Guiana. Cecil died;
the rising favourite, Villiers, was a person whose influence could
be secured--at a price; and at last, after more than twelve years of
captivity, Raleigh was released, to prepare for his last voyage. But
the attitude of England to Spain had changed since Elizabeth’s death:
the ambassador Gondomar could twist King James round his little finger.
Raleigh meant to win his golden empire, and incidentally to teach the
old lesson of Spanish incapacity over again; Gondomar intended to use
that expedition for Raleigh’s destruction. Sir Walter played the game
on the old familiar theory of twenty--thirty--forty years before: that
success would excuse proceedings unauthorised, and even forbidden.
Every soul, from the king down, knew perfectly well that if the
adventurer did not set Spain at defiance, the adventure itself would be
a stupid farce.

So the greatest living Englishman was sent forth to his carefully
prepared destruction, to entangle himself in the toils laid by, and
at the bidding of, the minister of England’s old foe. Of course,
under the conditions the expedition was a disastrous failure. Raleigh
returned from it with a perfect knowledge that he was coming back to
irretrievable ruin and disgrace. It would have been easy enough for him
to find refuge in a French port; that he deliberately faced his fate
is sufficient proof that the charge of his having already sold himself
to France was a base slander. Raleigh’s enemies were everlastingly
accusing him of selling himself; they never produced a scintilla of
proof, and the sales were singularly unremunerative to a man who was as
careful of his own interests as any one when he did drive a bargain. He
had hardly landed in Plymouth when he was placed under arrest. Even now
he had an opportunity of escaping to France, but he refused to avail
himself of it. His doom was a foregone conclusion; the death sentence
passed on him in 1603 had never been cancelled.

He bore himself worthily; with the fortitude and dignity which were
almost a commonplace with Englishmen of the Tudor tradition. The king
of England, Elizabeth’s successor, struck off the head of the last of
the Elizabethan heroes, at the orders of the king of Spain. But the
degradation was only for a time. Spain had laid her enemy low; but the
lesson he had spent his life to teach his countrymen was bearing its
fruit even in the hour of his doom; to the men of Raleigh’s race was
destined the Empire of the seas, and of the new worlds which Spain had
arrogantly claimed.
